Forgetting to Update Address \nBy statute , you must report a change of address to DMV within ten days of moving. That is the case for the address associated with your license, as well as all the addresses associated with each registered vehicle, which may differ. It is not sufficient to only: write your new address on the back of your old license; tell the United States Postal Service; or inform the police officer writing you a ticket. If you fail to keep your address current , you will miss a suspension order and may be charged with operating an unregistered vehicle and/or aggravated unlicensed operation, both misdemeanors.

DMV makes driver license and vehicle registration information available for a fee using three methods: contract sales, pay - per - search and over - the - counter. Anyone who accesses DMV information must comply with the federal Driver s Privacy Protection Act [1] DPPA. The DPPA was enacted by Congress after a careful debate about why states should be allowed to share DMV data. The DPPA prohibits states from disclosing a driver s personal information to anyone who does not have what the DPPA considers a permissible use. The DPPA defines personal information as an individual s photograph, social security number, driver identification number, name, address, telephone number and medical information. Information on crashes, driving violations, and driver's status is not considered personal information. Social security numbers are sold. \n\n1. Contract Sales \nIn accordance with the federal DPPA and NY State law , DMV sells registration and vehicle data through an open procurement process every two years. The successful bidders cannot use DMV information for any purposes other than those in connection with the issuance of a manufacturer s warranty, safety recall or similar notices important things that keep the public safe. The data can be used for statistical compilations and analysis, which do not contain any personal, identifying information. The DMV does not permit successful bidders to use the data for surveys, marketing, or solicitations. DMV collects approximately $2.2 million per year from contract sales.",

This is known as a' default conviction. ' The default conviction is equivalent to a guilty finding. The DMV then suspends your driver license for your failure to pay the fine. To terminate the suspension resulting from the default conviction , you must pay the fine, mandatory surcharge and the suspension termination fees. Note: Some convictions can cause the suspension or the revocation of your driver license. For more information , see Suspensions and Revocations [4] or read the DMV brochure Suppose Your License Were Taken Away [5]. \n\nWhat happens if I plead guilty to a violation that results in 5 or more points? \nIf you have 3 or more alcohol - related convictions on your entire driving record , a plea of guilty to a violation that results in 5 or more points may result in the revocation of your license under Part 132 of the Commissioner's Regulations. You may want to consult with an attorney before entering your plea.

To answer these types of traffic tickets , contact the court directly. A suspension due to a traffic ticket is an' indefinite' suspension.

A DMV inspector may contact you to ask questions or discuss your case in detail. These inspectors are experienced automotive technicians trained to investigate and resolve complaints .

If you suffer a financial loss due to overcharging or unnecessary or poor quality repairs, the administrative law judge presiding at the hearing may offer the shop the option of paying restitution. The shop may then receive a shorter suspension period and/or a lower fine . DMV cannot force a shop to pay restitution.

This disability planner helps you find out : how you can qualify and apply for benefits ; what happens if your application is approved ; who can receive benefits on your earnings record ; what you need to know about receiving disability benefits ; when Medicare coverage starts for Social Security disability beneficiaries ; and what happens if you go back to work. \n\nDisability and Supplemental Security Income \nWe pay disability benefits under two programs : The Social Security disability insurance program pays benefits to you and certain family members if you worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes. Your adult child also may qualify for benefits on your earnings record if he or she has a disability that started before age 22. The Supplemental Security Income SSI program pays benefits to disabled adults and children who have limited income and resources. For most people , the medical requirements are the same under both programs and disability is determined by the same process.

While we spend a lot of time working to succeed in our jobs and careers , few of us think about ensuring that we have a safety net to fall back on should we become disabled. This is an area where Social Security can provide valuable help to you. This disability planner helps you find out : how you can qualify and apply for benefits ; what happens if your application is approved ; who can receive benefits on your earnings record ; what you need to know about receiving disability benefits ; when Medicare coverage starts for Social Security disability beneficiaries ; and what happens if you go back to work. \n\nDisability and Supplemental Security Income \nWe pay disability benefits under two programs : The Social Security disability insurance program pays benefits to you and certain family members if you worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes. Your adult child also may qualify for benefits on your earnings record if he or she has a disability that started before age 22. The Supplemental Security Income SSI program pays benefits to disabled adults and children who have limited income and resources. For most people , the medical requirements are the same under both programs and disability is determined by the same process. Whether you apply for Social Security disability or SSI , we ask you for information about your medical condition, work, and education history to help us decide if you are disabled under our rules.

Special forbearance : This plan gives you some extra time to repay the missed mortgage payments. Loan modification : Sometimes you need a fresh start. This plan lets you add the missed mortgage payments and any related legal costs to your total loan balance. You and your servicer then come up with a new mortgage payment schedule. Extra time to arrange a private sale : If you need to sell your home, this plan lets you delay a foreclosure so you have time to sell. Short sale : If you owe more money than your house is worth , your servicer might agree to a short sale. This means the servicer will accept the total proceeds from the home sale even if it s less than the full amount you owe on the mortgage as full payment of the debt you owe. Deed in lieu of foreclosure : This plan lets you avoid the foreclosure process by signing over the deed to the home to your servicer. The home will then belong to the servicer.

Through the end of 2018 , the ACA required all U.S. taxpayers to have health coverage that met a minimum standard called the minimum essential coverage requirement unless they qualified for an exemption due to certain life events, financial status, or other factors. This meant that if you had affordable health coverage options, but chose not to buy health insurance, you would have to pay a fee when filing your taxes. This fee was known as an individual shared responsibility payment. It was also sometimes called the penalty, fine, or individual mandate. Congress changed this part of the law for plans starting in 2019 and after. The individual shared responsibility payment no longer applies starting in plan year 2019 for which you ll file taxes in April 2020.

While many factors are involved in the decision to attend college , a strong correlation exists between FAFSA completion and college enrollment. Previously , high schools relied on self - reported surveys to estimate their FAFSA completion rate , and that data can be inaccurate. For this reason , Federal Student Aid is providing high schools with current data about their FAFSA submissions and completions so that high schools can track their progress and help to ensure that their students complete a FAFSA. A completed FAFSA allows the U.S. Department of Education to determine a potential student's eligibility for federal student aid a key factor in families' college decisions. The data included in the attached charts reflect the number of submitted and completed FAFSAs among first - time filing applicants no older than 19 at the cutoff date who will have received their high school diploma by the start of the school year to which they are applying for aid. For each high school , the number of submitted and completed applications is reported for the current application cycle 2020 - 2021 and the same time period last year for the previous application cycle 2019 - 2020. The data is displayed in spreadsheets broken down by state or territory that include the school name and city of the high school. Additional tabs within each spreadsheet now include estimates of public school district FAFSA completion rates for both cycles as well as state level maps presenting this data.

Having a budget will help you compare anticipated college or career school expenses against your potential available income and financial aid. You also can use a budget to compare costs between different schools. Learn about budgeting. College or career school costs can vary significantly and there are many schools with affordable tuition and generous financial assistance. Make sure to research all schools that may meet your academic and financial needs. To find colleges or career schools , use our college search tool, College Navigator. You may be able to get school credit based on your knowledge or life experiences , and you can manage your course work to reduce costs. Ask your school whether it s possible to test out of any classes. If you don t take a class , you may not have to pay for the credits. Some colleges give credit for life experiences, thereby reducing the number of credits needed for graduation. Most schools charge a set price for a specific number of credits taken in a semester. If academically possible , take the maximum number of credits allowed. This strategy reduces the amount of time needed to graduate. Some schools offer combined degree programs or three - year programs that allow you to take all of the courses needed for graduation in three years, instead of four, thereby eliminating one year's educational expenses. Colleges and career schools may offer discounts on tuition if you are a child of an alumnus or alumna i.e., if your parent went to the school ; more than one family member is enrolled at the school ; you are a student government leader or the editor of the college newspaper or yearbook ; you are an older student ; your family s main wage earner is unemployed ; or you or a member of your family works at the school.

First , find the cost of attendance for your program on the aid offer. If the school doesn t list the cost of attendance on the aid offer , ask the financial aid office for this figure. Make sure it includes amounts you will pay to the school directly such as tuition and fees as well as other costs such as living expenses, books and supplies, and transportation. Next , subtract the grant and scholarship amounts on your aid offer from the cost of attendance amount. Also subtract any savings you have available to put toward your school costs for the school year. The remaining amount is your net or out - of - pocket cost. Compare the net costs for the schools you are considering. The net cost is the amount you will have to pay out of your pocket, using earnings from work or loan funds that you borrow. If you have any questions or don t understand what s in your aid offer , contact the financial aid office at the school. They re there to help! For instance , it s important to understand what you re being offered e.g., which items in the offer are grants and which are loans. You also need to think about which aid to accept. Also , because your aid offer might include student loans , it s important for you to compare the amount of debt you would be taking on at the schools you are considering.

This means that you must provide your loan servicer with updated income and family size information so that your servicer can recalculate your payment.

A third - party servicer may be an individual, a state, or a private, profit or non - profit organization that enters into a contract with an eligible institution to administer, through manual or automated processing, any aspect of the institution s participation in any federal student aid programs. When contracting with an institution , a third - party servicer and/or its contractors must comply with the various Title IV requirements applicable to its servicing agreement with the school. A third - party servicer is jointly and severally liable with the institution for any violation of Title IV requirements resulting from the functions performed by the third - party servicer. The Title IV regulations authorize the U.S. Department of Education ED to provide oversight of third - party servicers. As part of its oversight duties , Federal Student Aid FSA routinely conducts program reviews to confirm that third - party servicers and the schools that they contract with meet FSA requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability. During program reviews , reviewers evaluate the third - party servicers and schools compliance with FSA requirements, assess liabilities for errors in performance, and identify actions the third - party servicers and their partner schools must take to improve future administrative capabilities. After completing a program review , FSA issues a Final Program Review Determination FPRD, which is a report that includes each specific finding, the third party servicer s response, and ED s final determination. The FPRD also identifies liabilities, if any,",

The timing of the aid offer varies from school to school and could be as early as winter awarding for the fall or as late as immediately before you start school. It depends on when you apply and how the school prefers to schedule awarding of aid. \n\nProvide Required Verification \nYou might see a note on your SAR saying you ve been selected for verification ; or your school might contact you to inform you that you ve been selected. Verification is the process your school uses to confirm that the data reported on your FAFSA form is accurate. If you re selected for verification , your school will request additional documentation that supports the information you reported. Don t assume you re being accused of doing anything wrong. Some people are selected for verification at random ; and some schools verify all students' FAFSA forms. All you need to do is provide the documentation your school asks for and be sure to do so by the school s deadline , or you won t be able to get financial aid. If you used the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool IRS DRT when filling out your FAFSA form , you may not have to verify that information.

The financial aid staff starts by deciding upon your cost of attendance COA at that school. They then consider your Expected Family Contribution EFC. They subtract your EFC from your COA to determine the amount of your financial need and therefore how much need - based aid you can get.

In aggregating the data , our standard practice is to report the school name that is most commonly reported by applicants. However , when we are unable to determine if school name variations are referring to the same school , we err on the side of caution and do not aggregate the data to a single record and applicant count. In that instance , it may appear that there are duplicates of the same school. Email us at HSFAFSA@ed.gov if you believe your school has been listed more than once. \n\nLow Completion Totals \n\n\nWhy is my number of FAFSA submissions or completions lower than I think it should be? \nWhile we know that many high schools inadvertently overestimate their FAFSA completion rates , one reason your rates may be lower than expected is because your school could be listed more than once. This happens if students entered your school name in different ways on the FAFSA form. For instance , if some students listed \" John Doe High School \" and other students listed \" Doe High School , \" then your high school could be listed in more than one place. Please look for alternate names for your school. Email us at HSFAFSA@ed.gov if you find your school has been listed more than once. \n\nI am a high school counselor or college access professional.

A D / E rate is based on the typical loan debt and earnings of a cohort of the program s former students who completed the program, usually those who completed during a two - year period concluding two years prior to the D / E rate calculation year. This delay is to account for the ramping up of the students earnings upon completion of the program.

For the Annual Earnings Rate , the numerator is the calculated annual loan payment amount an estimate of the annual loan repayment amount based on the median educational debt of the members of the cohort. The denominator is the higher of the cohort s mean or median earnings obtained from the Social Security Administration SSA.

Most two - year and four - year colleges will calculate your COA to show your total cost for the school year for instance, for the fall semester plus the spring semester. Schools with programs that last a different period of time for instance, an 18-month certificate program might give you a COA that covers a time period other than a year. If you're attending at least half - time , your COA is the estimate of tuition and fees; the cost of room and board or living expenses for students who do not contract with the school for room and board ; the cost of books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and miscellaneous expenses including a reasonable amount for the documented cost of a personal computer ; an allowance for child care or other dependent care ; costs related to a disability ; and/or reasonable costs for eligible study - abroad programs. \n\nWhat s the Expected Family Contribution (EFC)? \nYour EFC is an index number that college financial aid staff use to determine how much financial aid you would receive if you were to attend their school. The information you report on your FAFSA form is used to calculate your EFC. The EFC is calculated according to a formula established by law. Your family's taxed and untaxed income, assets, and benefits such as unemployment or Social Security all could be considered in the formula. Also considered are your family size and the number of family members who will attend college or career school during the year. The EFC Formula guide shows exactly how an EFC is calculated.",

To qualify , the payment you would be required to make under the PAYE or IBR plan based on your income and family size must be less than what you would pay under the Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period. If the amount you would have to pay under the PAYE or IBR plan based on your income and family size is more than what you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan , you wouldn't benefit from having your monthly payment amount based on your income , so you don't qualify. Generally , you'll meet this requirement if your federal student loan debt is higher than your annual discretionary income or represents a significant portion of your annual income. In addition to meeting the requirement described above , to qualify for the PAYE Plan you must also be a new borrower. This means that you must have had no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan when you received a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2007, and you must have received a disbursement of a Direct Loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2011. \n\nICR Plan \nAny borrower with eligible federal student loans can make payments under this plan.

For any income - driven repayment plan , periods of economic hardship deferment , periods of repayment under certain other repayment plans , and periods when your required payment is zero will count toward your total repayment period. Whether you will have a balance left to be forgiven at the end of your repayment period depends on a number of factors, such as how quickly your income rises and how large your income is relative to your debt. Because of these factors , you may fully repay your loan before the end of your repayment period. Your loan servicer will track your qualifying monthly payments and years of repayment and will notify you when you are getting close to the point when you would qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance.

This time limit does not apply to Direct Unsubsidized Loans or Direct PLUS Loans. If this limit applies to you , you may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for more than 150 percent of the published length of your program. This is called your maximum eligibility period. Your maximum eligibility period is generally based on the published length of your current program. You can usually find the published length of any program of study in your school s catalog. For example , if you are enrolled in a four - year bachelor s degree program , the maximum period for which you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans is six years 150 percent of 4 years = 6 years. If you are enrolled in a two - year associate degree program , the maximum period for which you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans is three years 150 percent of 2 years = 3 years. Because your maximum eligibility period is based on the length of your current program of study , your maximum eligibility period can change if you change to a program that has a different length. Also , if you receive Direct Subsidized Loans for one program and then change to another program , the Direct Subsidized Loans you received for the earlier program will generally count toward your new maximum eligibility period. Certain types of enrollment may cause you to become responsible for the interest that accrues on your Direct Subsidized Loans when the U.S. Department of Education usually would have paid it.

Since school names are inherently student - reported , the reported name can vary considerably. In aggregating the data , our standard practice is to report the school name that is most commonly reported by applicants. It is possible this name is different than your formal school name. As a result , it is important to look for other variations of your school name and city. You do not need to request to be added to the list.

What could be causing this? How do I go about getting my school included? \nWith a few exceptions discussed below , most high schools should be contained in our database on the FAFSA form. If you can t find your school , double - check your spelling of the city and school name , and then try your search again. Also , consider alternate names or cities that may be used. Sometimes the official location of the school reported to us is a suburb within a larger city, or vice - versa. If after trying various possibilities you still cannot find your institution , you may still continue forward by clicking next. Despite being unable to find your school , the information you type in will still be captured and recorded, so be sure the spelling is correct. For public schools , our database should contain every high school in the nation, unless the school was opened, merged, or otherwise changed its name within the past year or two. If you fit into one of these categories , your school may not be listed within the current FAFSA form, but will be listed on future FAFSA forms. For private schools , our database contains every high school that has participated in the U.S. Department of Education's Private School Survey.

      "studentaid_#Questions and Answers About FAFSA\u00ae Completion Data | Federal Student Aid#1_0_#7": "Can I add up all the submitted applications from a single state file to calculate a state total? What about adding up all the submitted applications from a single city? \nThe answer to both questions is no. The official location of a school or the location most commonly reported by students may actually be a suburb falling within a larger city's limits. For example , adding up all the applications reported under \" New York City \" would exclude any institutions reported being within \" Queens \" or even within \" Jamaica, \" a smaller neighborhood within the New York City Borough of Queens. Any analysis must also consider the impact of withholding the totals or names of schools with fewer than five completed applications. At its most basic level , summing the number of applications reported in these files always underestimates the number of applications. If an institution is reported as having \" <5 \" completed applications , one cannot assume there were zero applications. Further , the totals for some schools are never made public because their class sizes essentially preclude them from having enough completed applications to ever be disclosed publicly. Because this impacts some areas more than others , be sure to consider these and other factors when conducting any analyses. \n\nWhy do some districts appear in white on the maps? \nDistricts are listed as missing / insufficient data if any of the following conditions are true : The regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate is missing e.g., if districts merged or a new district was created after 2009 10. A district has fewer than 15 students in the regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate data. There s an unpredicted increase in the number of district graduating seniors e.g., a dramatic increase in the graduation rate, or if two districts merge under one district's name.

Why are my numbers so low? \nBecause there is no question on the FAFSA form that asks if an applicant is a high school senior , we must use several criteria to identify those applicants that are likely high school seniors. In this instance , the bulk of the students would likely not satisfy the age criteria requiring applicants to be less than 20 years of age at the cutoff date. Also , students must also be receiving their high school diploma, as opposed to a GED or other program, to fit this definition of a high school senior. \n\nTechnical and Analytical \n\n\nThe totals reported last year are different from the numbers reported now about last year. What is causing this? \nThere could be several causes for this, including the possibility that your institution is listed more than once in the data using alternate variations of the school's name or city. One other cause is a change we made in 2017 to our definition of a high school senior, which now aligns with other data we publicly release. In past years, we used proxies to determine whether an applicant was a first - time filer ; we now use true first - time filer status as one criterion for being a senior. While this impacts a relatively small number of applicants, if your total decreased compared to what we reported last year , then this may mean there were applicants that had applied in a previous year.",

      "studentaid_#Get Temporary Relief | Federal Student Aid#1_0_#4": "Explore Student Loan Deferment and Forbearance \nIf you re eligible for a deferment or forbearance , you can temporarily suspend your payments. If you choose to use a deferment or forbearance , consider paying the interest that accrues during that period, so that you can avoid some of the consequences. Here is an example of the impact of forbearance : If you have a loan balance of $30,000 and an interest rate of 6% and you are in forbearance for a year right after you enter repayment , $ 1,800 in interest will accrue on your loans. If you do not pay that interest , it will capitalize be added to your principal balance. Because interest accrues on your principal balance , capitalization will cause more interest to accrue over time than if you had paid the interest. It will also increase your monthly payment under most repayment plans. In this example , if you were on the Standard Repayment Plan , interest capitalization would increase your monthly payment by $20 per month and increase the total amount that you would pay by about $600.

Where can I obtain a copy of my academic transcript? \nContact the state licensing agency in the state where the school was located to find out if the state has the records. \n\nMy school informed me that they have arranged a teach-out with neighboring schools. What is a teach-out? \nA teach - out is a written agreement between schools that provides for the equitable treatment of students and a reasonable opportunity for students to complete their program of study if a school ceases to operate before all students have completed their program of study. \n\nIf my school closes and I then enroll in a comparable program at another school, can I still receive a discharge of the loans I received at the closed school? \nIt depends. If you completed or are in the process of completing a comparable program of study at another school through a teach - out , by transferring academic credits or hours from the closed school, or by any other comparable means , you are not eligible for a closed school discharge. However , you may be eligible for discharge if you completed or are in the process of completing a comparable program at another school , but you did not participate in a teach - out, transfer credits or hours from the closed school, or benefit from the training you received at the closed school by any other comparable means, and if you otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for a closed school discharge.",

If you 1) attended a school that closed less than three years ago, 2) meet the eligibility requirements for a closed school discharge, and 3) want your loans discharged, contact your loan servicer about applying for a closed school discharge now instead of waiting for three years to receive an automatic closed school discharge. \n\nQ&A on Closed School Loan Discharges \n\n\nWhat benefits do I have by receiving a closed school loan discharge? \nBy receiving a closed school loan discharge , you have no further obligation to repay the loan , you will receive reimbursement of payments made voluntarily or through forced collection , and the record of the loan and all repayment history associated with the loan, including any adverse history, will be deleted from your credit report. \n\nI have nonfederal loans through private lenders.

      "studentaid_#Getting Out of Default | Federal Student Aid#1_0_#9": "Another option for getting out of default is to consolidate your defaulted federal student loan into a Direct Consolidation Loan. Loan consolidation allows you to pay off one or more federal student loans with a new consolidation loan. To consolidate a defaulted federal student loan into a new Direct Consolidation Loan , you must either agree to repay the new Direct Consolidation Loan under an income - driven repayment plan, or make three consecutive, voluntary, on - time, full monthly payments on the defaulted loan before you consolidate it. Note: If you choose to make three payments on the defaulted loan before you consolidate it , the required payment amount will be determined by your loan holder, but cannot be more than what is reasonable and affordable based on your total financial circumstances. There are special considerations if you want to reconsolidate an existing Direct Consolidation Loan or Federal FFEL Consolidation Loan that is in default : To reconsolidate a defaulted Direct Consolidation Loan , you must also include at least one other eligible loan in the consolidation in addition to meeting one of the two requirements described above. If you have no other eligible loans that can be included in the consolidation , you cannot get out of default by consolidating a defaulted Direct Consolidation Loan. Your options are repayment in full or loan rehabilitation. You may reconsolidate a defaulted FFEL Consolidation Loan without including any additional loans in the consolidation, but only if you agree to repay the new Direct Consolidation Loan under an income - driven repayment plan. If you include at least one other eligible loan in the consolidation , you re eligible to reconsolidate a defaulted FFEL Consolidation Loan if you meet either of the two requirements described above. In addition , if you want to consolidate a defaulted loan that is being collected through garnishment of your wages, or that is being collected in accordance with a court order after a judgment was obtained against you , you cannot consolidate the loan unless the wage garnishment order has been lifted or the judgment has been vacated.",
      "studentaid_#Loans | Federal Student Aid#1_0_#5": "Before you take out a loan , it s important to understand that a loan is a legal obligation that makes you responsible for repaying the amount you borrow with interest. Even though you don t have to begin repaying your federal student loans right away , you shouldn t wait to understand your responsibilities as a borrower. Get the scoop: Watch this video about responsible borrowing or browse the tips below it. Be a responsible borrower. Keep track of how much you re borrowing. Think about how the amount of your loans will affect your future finances, and how much you can afford to repay. Your student loan payments should be only a small percentage of your salary after you graduate , so it s important not to borrow more than you need for your school - related expenses. Research starting salaries in your field. Ask your school for starting salaries of recent graduates in your field of study to get an idea of how much you are likely to earn after you graduate. You can also use the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook or career search tool to research careers and salaries. Understand the terms of your loan and keep copies of your loan documents. When you sign your promissory note , you are agreeing to repay the loan according to the terms of the note even if you don t complete your education, can t get a job after you complete the program, or you didn t like the education you received. Make payments on time. You are required to make payments on time even if you don t receive a bill, repayment notice, or a reminder. You must pay the full amount required by your repayment plan, as partial payments do not fulfill your obligation to repay your student loan on time. Keep in touch with your loan servicer.

      "studentaid_#Total and Permanent Disability Discharge | Federal Student Aid#1_0_#10": "Because of a change in federal law related to the taxability of loan amounts discharged due to TPD , the answer depends on when you received the discharge. If you received a TPD discharge of a loan before Jan. 1 , 2018 , the loan amount discharged may be considered income for federal tax purposes under Internal Revenue Service IRS rules. If you received a TPD discharge of a loan during the period from Jan. 1 , 2018 to Dec. 31 , 2025 , the discharged loan amount won t be considered income for federal tax purposes. For purposes of determining whether a loan amount discharged due to TPD may be treated as taxable income for federal tax purposes , the date you are considered to have received the discharge is different depending on how you qualified for the discharge. If you re a veteran who showed that you re totally and permanently disabled based on a disability determination by the VA , you re considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes on the date we approve the discharge. If you showed that you re totally and permanently disabled based on documentation from the SSA or a physician s certification meaning that you re subject to a three - year postdischarge monitoring period , you re considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes at the end of the postdischarge monitoring period. For example , if your discharge was approved in July 2017 , you would not be considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes until July 2020, at the end of the three - year postdischarge monitoring period.
