Not Bringing Proper Documentation to DMV Office \nAbout ten percent of customers visiting a DMV office do not bring what they need to complete their transaction, and have to come back a second time to finish their business. This can be as simple as not bringing sufficient funds to pay for a license renewal or not having the proof of auto insurance required to register a car. Better yet , don t visit a DMV office at all, and see if your transaction can be performed online, like an address change, registration renewal, license renewal, replacing a lost title, paying a DRA or scheduling a road test.

Letting Insurance Lapse \nBecause we all pay indirectly for crashes involving uninsured motorists , New York State requires every motorist to maintain auto insurance every single day a vehicle is registered. DMV works with insurance companies to electronically monitor your insurance coverage , and we know when coverage is dropped for any reason. When that happens , we mail you an insurance inquiry letter to allow you to clear up the problem. We send 500,000 inquiry letters a year. If the inquiry letter does not resolve the problem , we must suspend the vehicle registration and , if it persists, your driver license!We suspend 300,000 registrations a year for failure to maintain insurance. If you fail to maintain an updated address with us , you won t learn that you have an insurance problem , and we will suspend your registration and license.

Often , motorists convicted of a traffic ticket feel they have resolved all their motoring issues with the local court, but later learn that the Driver Responsibility Assessment DRA is a separate DMV charge based on the total points they accumulate. The $300 DRA fee can be paid in $100 annual installments over three years. Motorists who fail to maintain an updated address with DMV may resolve their tickets with the court, but never receive their DRA assessment because we do not have their new address on record.

Forgetting to Update Address \nBy statute , you must report a change of address to DMV within ten days of moving. That is the case for the address associated with your license, as well as all the addresses associated with each registered vehicle, which may differ.

Leaving the State Without Notifying DMV \nStates communicate with each other , so when you move to another state, be sure to tie up any loose ends regarding your New York State license or registration. That means resolving any unanswered tickets, suspensions or revocations, and surrendering your license plates to NYS when you get to your new home state. A license suspension or revocation here could mean that your new home state will not issue you a license there.

However , the DMV will not accept a card if the DMV barcode reader cannot read scan the barcode. \n\nOut-of-state insurance documents \nWe will never accept out - of - state vehicle insurance coverage of any type. If your vehicle is registered in New York , it must have New York State auto liability insurance coverage. Your motorcycle must have insurance coverage any time it is operated on a public road or highway. Unlike most other motor vehicles, motorcycles are registered for one year rather than two , and all motorcycle registrations expire on April 30. Also , you can terminate your motorcycle liability insurance without surrendering the plate at a DMV office. This makes it easier to put the motorcycle back on the road after winter storage. However , under no circumstances may your motorcycle operate on public highways without liability coverage in effect. A change on the insurance policy to a name different from the name on your registration may cause a lapse in insurance coverage , and DMV may suspend your driver license and your vehicle registration. Your vehicle's insurance and registration must always be in exactly the same name. You should always carry the paper or access to your digital electronic NY State Insurance ID Card in your vehicle.

I do not meet the USDOT federal medical requirements, and I cannot obtain a Medical Examiner s Certificate. I do not operate in any federal excepted operation, but I was able to keep my CDL because it was issued prior to 9/9/1999. Can I still keep my CDL license? \nYes , you are eligible for Excepted Intrastate operation EA. You must ensure that your CDL has the required restrictions: K CDL Intrastate Only and A3 Med Cert Exempt. CDL holders that certify to EA can only operate a commercial motor vehicle within New York State, and cannot deliver cargo coming from, or being delivered to, another state or foreign country.",
                  "9. Why did I receive my Medical Examiner s Certificate back in the mail with a rejection letter? \nThe rejection letter indicates why the Medical Examiner s Certificate is being returned to you. If information was incorrect, missing or illegible , you must contact your physician to have the form amended or another form completed. If your Medical Examiners Certificate was rejected because it was not completed by a doctor listed on the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners , you must have a new exam completed by a doctor on the registry. To find a certified doctor in your area please visit the Federal website at National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners Search [1]. \n\n10. If I downgrade my license to a non-commercial class, am I eligible for a refund? \nNo refund will be given as the driver will have the remainder of the renewal period as well as the two year grace period to be granted back the CDL without re - testing requirements. A refund is only allowed by law if the license is surrendered in full and there is 4 years or more remaining at the time of surrender. \n\n11. Will you send me a reminder when my Medical Examiner s Certificate or my medical variance is going to expire? \nYes , DMV sends reminders to CDL and CLP holders who have registered to receive email and/or text reminders about the status of their medical certifications [2] and medical variances [3]. To register to receive these reminders , go to Get email and/or text reminders [4]. Failure to submit an updated Medical Examiner s Certificate, or medical variance, prior to the expiration date of the one on file may result in your CDL being downgraded. You should allow at least two weeks to process your updated documents.",
                  "7. I work for a \"private\" company that provides school bus service to local school systems. Do I need to provide a Medical Examiner s Certificate or can I certify to \"EI\"? \nIf you operate or expect to operate in an excepted operation such as school operation for a private service , you can choose EI. School operation is defined as \" school to home / home to school \" operation and includes interstate operation for school operation only. This does not include field trips. Only applicants employed by a municipality can drive for out - of - state field trips. It is important to remember that when you choose driving type EI, you are limited to driving only for an excepted operation. NOTE: If you are capable of obtaining a Medical Examiner s Certificate , then the NI driving type will allow for the broadest commercial operation capability with no license restrictions applied. \n\n8. I have a current CDL license with no restrictions. I do NOT have a Medical Examiner s Certificate and I do not use my CDL license to drive commercially. For example I am retired, not working, etc. I don t want to downgrade my license because I paid for a CDL and have several years before it expires. What driving type should I choose? \nFederal regulations require all CDL drivers to certify to the type of driving in which they operate or expect to operate. You should choose the box which describes the type of driving that you perform or expect to perform. If you expect to operate in an excepted driving type EA or EI then a Medical Examiner s Certificate is not required. You will need to have the appropriate restrictions added to your driver s license A3 and/or K. If you expect to operate in a non - excepted driving type NA or NI then a Medical Examiner s Certificate is required. Remember , your certification can be changed anytime at a local DMV office through a license amendment transaction.",
                  "Self-Certification \n\n\n1. Why do I have to self-certify? \nNew federal regulations require all commercial drivers to certify to the Department of Motor Vehicles DMV the type of driving they perform or expect to perform. Drivers that self - certify to a non - excepted driving type NA or NI are also required to submit a copy of their USDOT Medical Examiner s Certificate. This is a nationwide safety initiative that affects commercial driver in all states. \n\n2. What are the self-certification driving types? \nNon - Excepted Interstate NI : Commercial driving operation is permitted across state lines , and you are required to meet the Federal medical requirements Non - Excepted Intrastate NA : Commercial driving operation is restricted to New York State only , and you are required to meet the Federal medical requirements Excepted Interstate EI : Commercial driving operation is permitted across state lines for excepted operation only and you are exempt from the Federal medical requirements Excepted Intrastate EA : Commercial driving operation is restricted to New York State, permitted for excepted operation only and you are exempt from the Federal medical requirements. \n\n3. What if my driving type changes? \nIf your driving type changes , you must go into your local DMV office to change your self - certification driving type and have your license amended to add or delete the appropriate restrictions. A transaction fee will apply. If you are self - certifying to a non - excepted driving type NA or NI you will need to bring a copy of your valid USDOT Medical Examiners Certificate if it is not already on file with DMV. \n\n4. Can I change my self-certification driving type online? \nNo , you must go into a DMV office."

This allows courts in these areas to concentrate on criminal cases, including driving offenses, such as driving while intoxicated and driving while suspended or revoked aggravated unlicensed operation. However , TVBs do not handle parking violations. If you plead not guilty to a traffic ticket in one of these TVB areas , your case will be heard by a DMV Administrative Law Judge ALJ, an experienced attorney with special training in the Vehicle and Traffic Law. An ALJ has the authority to decide whether or not you are guilty and to set a fine if you are found guilty. An ALJ also has the authority to revoke or suspend your driver license and/or auto registration when required by law or when the ALJ believes it is in the interest of traffic safety. Just as in traffic courts in other areas of the state , you may present witnesses and evidence at a hearing before an ALJ and be represented by an attorney.",

A felony conviction may result in fines of up to $5,000, jail, probation, or confiscation of your vehicle. As the number of suspensions you have increases , the penalties also increase. A driver is suspended for ticket not answered and fine not paid. To Plead Not Guilty - Use the Traffic Ticket Pleas, Hearings and Payments online transaction [1] or read the \" not guilty \" instructions and check the \" not guilty \" box on the back of the ticket.

                  "What if I fail the quizzes, tests or final exam? \nThe test and exam process and the effect of results can vary from one sponsor to another. Carefully read the information about tests before you register for the course. The course normally requires you to answer 70% of course content questions correctly. You normally will have two tries to get the correct answer to a question. Tests are timed , and you will have limited time during a test to look for an answer that you do not know. It is recommended that you review the section content before you begin the tests. \n\nWhat if I fail the course? Can I receive a course fee refund? \nIf you do not meet all the requirements to complete the course or meet the minimum test score requirements , you cannot receive credit for course completion and you cannot receive point and insurance reduction for the course. A sponsor can offer for you to take the same course again at no additional costs. The sponsor is not required to offer this. \n\nWhat is the cost of an I-PIRP course? \nThe cost is set by the course sponsor and the fee varies from one course to another course. Your cost is stated clearly before you register for the course. It is to your advantage to compare courses and their fees. \n\nHow do I pay for an I-PIRP course? \nThe sponsor will normally require you to pay with a credit card , but this is determined by each sponsor. Check with the sponsor for complete information about payment. \n\nWhat is the procedure for course cancellation and/or refunds? \nIf the sponsor cannot conduct the course or any part of the course , they must give you the option to receive a full refund of all course fees. The sponsor can also offer you the option to reschedule the course, if and when the course is available.",
                  "What type of equipment and technology do I need to take an I-PIRP course? \nThe answer depends on the alternate delivery method ADM of the course. For example , if the course is an Internet course , you must have a computer and an acceptable connection to the Internet. For a DVD ADM course , you must have a television and a DVD player. The sponsors must provide any additional technology required to deliver the course. The sponsor must inform you of these requirements when you register for the course. \n\nHow and when do I receive my course completion certificate? \nThe course sponsor mails the course completion certificate to you by regular mail. An email copy of the certificate is not valid and will not be accepted by your insurance company. The course sponsor must issue the course completion certificates within 14 business days of course completion. Some sponsors offer express mail delivery options at an additional fee. \n\nDoes the DMV send my completion certificate directly to my automobile insurance company? \nNo. You must contact the insurance company and supply your certificate to them for insurance reduction benefits. \n\nAre the I-PIRP websites secured? \nYes. The DMV requires that the sponsors and their delivery agents provide secure websites that protect the personal information of those who take the courses. \n\nWhat personal information is required to take the course? \nThe sponsors collect personal information to verify your identity and your participation. This can include identity information like the DMV ID Number Client ID Number from your NY State driver license and your name and date of birth. You should make sure to use your name exactly as it appears on your New York State Driver License don t use nick names. The sponsor will also collect credit card information for the course fee. Identification and participation information can also include biometrics like keystrokes, facial recognition or voice recognition.",
                  "How does the I-PIRP course compare to the classroom course? \nBoth the classroom PIRP course and the I - PIRP course have very similar content and information , and both courses include 320 minutes of instruction. The classroom course is given in one daytime session or two evening sessions. You can take the I - PIRP course from home, at a convenient time for you. You must complete the I - PIRP course within 30 days of the date you register for the course. You can take the I - PIRP course at your own speed within the 30-day period. \n\nCan I log off and continue an I-PIRP course at a later time or use different computers for separate course sessions? \nYes. You can complete the course in as many sessions as necessary , but you must complete the course within 30 calendar days of registration. Your data will be stored online for each course session. Most sponsors assign you a user ID and a password when you register for the course. You can use your ID and password to log in on any computer that can access the Internet with an acceptable connection. \n\nAre there tests or a final exam for an I-PIRP course? \nAn I - PIRP course can have online quizzes, random tests and/or a final exam to verify your participation and determine if you understand the course content. Some sponsors may require you to take a final exam in person. Test requirements will be explained before you register for the course, normally in the course Terms and Conditions section. In addition to knowledge tests about course content , there will be questions to help verify your identity and participation in the course.",
                  "What is the I-PIRP/ADM Program? \nI - PIRP / ADM is an acronym for the Internet Point & Insurance Reduction Program / Alternate Delivery Method. This program permits approved sponsors to provide Defensive Driving / Accident Prevention courses via the Internet or other alternate delivery methods, such as DVD or digital cable. \n\nWho offers the I-PIRP courses? \nYou must be sure any course you take for point and insurance reduction in New York State is a course approved by the NY State DMV. See the list of DMV approved sponsors for I - PIRP courses [1]. \n\nDo I receive point and insurance reduction if I take an I-PIRP course? \nYes. When you complete an I - PIRP course , you receive the same benefits as when you complete a classroom PIRP course. You can reduce your driver violation point total by a maximum of four points , and you can save ten percent on your auto liability and collision insurance premiums. \n\nHow long does it take to complete an I-PIRP course? \nThe I - PIRP course requires a minimum of 320 minutes of instruction time. The instruction time does not include the time required to register, validate your identity and your participation, or to download and take any tests. The course site has controls to ensure you meet all the requirements and you have at least 320 minutes of instruction.",
                  "Is my personal information kept after I finish the course? \nRead the privacy and security information at the web site of the I - PIRP sponsors. The sponsors are required to store your personal information on a secure server for a time period specified by DMV. The DMV verifies the security of the servers that host the course. \n\nWhat is done to ensure that the person who registers for the course is the person who takes the course? \nEach course sponsor has different methods to validate that the person who registered for the course is the same person who takes the course. Any person who attempts to defraud the system or who accepts a course completion certificate and its associated benefits without having personally completed the entire course has committed a crime and may be subject to prosecution, fines and imprisonment. Important : If you don t have a New York State DMV ID Number Client ID Number from your NY State driver license , the ADM course completion can t be applied to your license record. You may have to file Request for Driver and/or Vehicle Record Information form PDF [2] MV-15 before you attempt to take an ADM course."

In addition , hundreds of vehicles are repaired at no additional cost. The Repair Shop Act also helps to make our highways safer by promoting quality auto repairs . The Repair Shop Act works best when consumers take the time to shop wisely for auto repairs, keep records of their dealings with shops, and discuss repairs with shop management to avoid misunderstandings. Additional information can be found at: Report a problem with a DMV regulated automotive business [4 ] (C-17) NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLESMark J. F. Schroeder , Commissioner Return to DMV Publications [5 ]",
                  "Under the Repair Shop Act , you have the following rights when dealing with a repair shop : Written Estimate If you request it , the repair shop must give you a written estimate of the parts and labor necessary for each specific repair. The shop may charge a reasonable fee for developing a written estimate , but the labor charge for an estimate may not exceed the shop's usual hourly labor charge . The estimate must list each part and its cost, and show what parts, if any, are either used or not of original quality. It must show the labor charges for each repair and by what method they are calculated. The shop may not charge more than the estimated price without your permission. Authorizing Work A shop may not perform any services unless you give your permission. If the shop prepares a written work order , it must give you a copy. If you prepare a written work order , the shop must attach it to the invoice. If work is authorized verbally or by telephone , the invoice must show the date, time, and name of the person giving authorization. Parts You are entitled to the return of all replaced parts, except warranty and exchange parts , but you must ask for them in writing before any work is done. If you authorize work by phone , the shop must keep any replaced parts, and make them available when you pick up the vehicle. Invoice When repairs are completed , the shop must give you a detailed invoice listing each repair done, each part replaced, the cost for each, and the cost of labor. The invoice must show which replacement parts, if any, are used, or not of original quality. It must show the odometer reading at the time you left the vehicle for repair and when the invoice was prepared. If the shop promised a delivery date , that must be listed on the repair order. If you received a written estimate , compare it with the invoice and try to resolve any questions before you pay for the repairs. Inspection After Repair You have the right to inspect your vehicle at the",
                  "What Happens to Your Complaint \nA DMV customer service representative will try to resolve the problem by discussing it with you and the shop. About half the complaints received by DMV are resolved through mediation . If the repair problem isn't resolved , your complaint will often be referred to a DMV regional office for investigation. A DMV inspector may contact you to ask questions or discuss your case in detail. These inspectors are experienced automotive technicians trained to investigate and resolve complaints . If the DMV investigation indicates the shop violated the Repair Shop Act or regulations, DMV will either send a warning letter to the shop or schedule a hearing. If a hearing determines there were violations , DMV will take action against the shop. This may include suspending or revoking the shop's registration and/or imposing fines . If you suffer a financial loss due to overcharging or unnecessary or poor quality repairs, the administrative law judge presiding at the hearing may offer the shop the option of paying restitution. The shop may then receive a shorter suspension period and/or a lower fine . DMV cannot force a shop to pay restitution. Restitution is limited to the amount you were overcharged or the cost of proper repairs. Other expenses, such as the cost of renting a replacement car, cannot be included. Filing a complaint with DMV does not prevent you from seeking help from other consumer protection agencies or from taking the shop to court. However , if you receive a court settlement or one is pending , restitution through DMV is not available.",

Keep a written record of all contacts with management in addition to details about the repair. Copies of work orders and invoices are proof of your attempts to resolve the problem .

The CSR will explain the nature of the complaint and will also inform you of your rights, responsibilities, and your liability. If the complaint is not resolved with the CSR , the case will be sent to an Automotive Facilities Inspector AFI for a formal investigation. Avoid costly penalties, fines, and the loss of valuable customersby responding to all DMV inquiries in a timely manner. The AFI will conduct a formal investigation. The result may be no action, a warning letter Notice of Investigation placed in your file, or a formal administrative hearing before an Administrative Law Judge ALJ. When Vehicle Safety initiates the hearing process , you may be offered the opportunity through a \" hearing waiver \" to admit to the charges and to either pay a specified monetary penalty and/or to accept a suspension. If the waiver is accepted , no hearing is required. If the offer is rejected , a hearing must be held. The result of the hearing may be no action, a civil penalty, and/or a suspension or revocation of your ability to operate as a vehicle related business in NYS. You may also be offered the opportunity to pay restitution to the consumer in lieu of the fines and/or penalties, or to have the penalty reduced.",

You will receive a letter from DMV shortly after the hearing. You will have 30 days from the date of the order by the judge to pay your fine or penalty. Failure to pay any fines or penalties or to serve out your suspension will result in indefinite suspension of your business certificate and the possible assessment of a lien against your business. However , if you pay your fine and/or penalty or serve out your period of suspension , you will be back in business after complete compliance. If you are revoked , you must surrender all supplies and cease to operate. You have the right to appeal any adverse decision. If you chose to appeal , you have 60 days from the date of the ALJs decision to file the Administrative Appeal Form [2] AA-33A, which must be accompanied by the appropriate filing fee."

You order IMJOE on a picture plate e.g., NASCAR, Yankees and pay the $62.50 annual custom plate fee $125 at the next two - year renewal in addition to other renewal fees, plus plate and document fees.

                  "Other Things You Need To Know \nThere are limits on how much survivors may earn while they receive benefits. Benefits for a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse may be affected by several additional factors : If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse remarries before they reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , they cannot receive benefits as a surviving spouse while they're married. If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse remarries after they reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , they will continue to qualify for benefits on your Social Security record. However , if their current spouse is a Social Security beneficiary , they may want to apply for spouse's benefits on their record. If that amount is more than the widow's or widower's benefit on your record , they will receive a combination of benefits that equals the higher amount. If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse receives benefits on your record , they can switch to their own retirement benefit as early as age 62. This assumes they're eligible for retirement benefits and their retirement rate is higher than their rate as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse. In many cases , a widow or widower can begin receiving one benefit at a reduced rate and then, at full retirement age, switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate. If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse will also receive a pension based on work not covered by Social Security, such as government or foreign work , their Social Security benefits as a survivor may be affected.",
                  "For Your Widow Or Widower \nThere are about five million widows and widowers receiving monthly Social Security benefits based on their deceased spouse's earnings record. And , for many of those survivors, particularly aged women, those benefits are keeping them out of poverty. Widows and widowers can receive : reduced benefits as early as age 60 or full benefits at full retirement age or older. benefits as early as age 50 if they're disabled AND their disability started before or within seven years of your death. benefits at any age , if they have not remarried , and if they take care of your child who is under age 16 or disabled and receives benefits on your record. If applying for disability benefits on a deceased worker s record , they can speed up the application process if they complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of their appointment. We use the same definition of disability for widows and widowers as we do for workers. \n\nFor Your Surviving Divorced Spouse \nIf you have a surviving divorced spouse , they could get the same benefits as your widow or widower provided that your marriage lasted 10 years or more. Benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse won't affect the benefit amounts your other survivors will receive based on your earnings record. If your former spouse is caring for your child who is under age 16 or disabled and gets benefits on your record , they will not have to meet the length - of - marriage rule. The child must be your natural or legally adopted child.",
                  "How Much Would Your Survivors Receive \nHow much your family could receive in benefits depends on your average lifetime earnings. The higher your earnings were , the higher their benefits would be. We calculate a basic amount as if you had reached full retirement age at the time you die. These are examples of monthly benefit payments : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of your benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 to full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of your basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower , age 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Your dependent parent , age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent. Two surviving parents 75 percent to each parent. Percentages for a surviving divorced spouse would be the same as above. There may also be a special lump - sum death payment. \n\nMaximum Family Amount \nThere's a limit to the amount that family members can receive each month. The limit varies , but it is generally equal to between 150 and 180 percent of the basic benefit rate. If the sum of the benefits payable to family members is greater than this limit , the benefits will be reduced proportionately. Any benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse based on disability or age won't count toward this maximum amount. Get your online or check our Benefit Calculators for an estimate of the benefits your family could receive if you died right now.",
                  "Benefits Planner: Survivors | Planning For Your Survivors \nAs you plan for the future , you'll want to think about what your family would need if you should die now. Social Security can help your family if you have earned enough Social Security credits through your work. You can earn up to four credits each year. In 2019 , for example , you earn one credit for each $1,360 of wages or self - employment income. When you have earned $5,440 , you have earned your four credits for the year. The number of credits needed to provide benefits for your survivors depends on your age when you die. No one needs more than 40 credits 10 years of work to be eligible for any Social Security benefit. But , the younger a person is , the fewer credits they must have for family members to receive survivors benefits. Benefits can be paid to your children and your spouse who is caring for the children even if you don't have the required number of credits. They can get benefits if you have credit for one and one - half years of work 6 credits in the three years just before your death.",
                  "For Your Children \nYour unmarried children who are under 18 up to age 19 if attending elementary or secondary school full time can be eligible to receive Social Security benefits when you die. And your child can get benefits at any age if they were disabled before age 22 and remain disabled. Besides your natural children , your stepchildren, grandchildren, step grandchildren or adopted children may receive benefits under certain circumstances. For further information , view our publication. \n\nFor Your Parents \nYou must have been providing at least half of your parent s support and your parent must not be eligible to receive a retirement benefit that is higher than the benefit we could pay on your record. Generally, your parent also must not have married after your death ; however, there are some exceptions. In addition to your natural parent , your stepparent or adoptive parent may receive benefits if they became your parent before you were age 16."

This type of benefit reduction is called GPO. Some individuals are exempt from the offset. If you want to know if you meet the requirements for an exemption , please read the \" When won't my Social Security benefits be reduced? \" section of our \" Government Pension Offset \" factsheet. \n\nInformation You Need to Calculate Your Benefits If You Are Affected by the GPO \nTo estimate your future spouse's, widow's, or widower's benefits under the GPO , you need two things : The estimated \" gross \" monthly amount of your pension from your government job not covered by Social Security. The estimated monthly amount of your Social Security benefit as a spouse, widow, or widower before the effect of GPO. \n\nIf you will be eligible for spouse's benefits and have access to your spouse's estimate: \nFind the estimated amount of the retirement benefit your spouse would be eligible to receive at full retirement age. If your spouse already receives benefits , ask them what their benefit would be if it started at their full or normal retirement age. Divide this amount in half and round down to the nearest dollar. This is your estimated spouse's benefit if you retire at full retirement age.",
                  "If you will be eligible for a Social Security retirement benefit based on your own earnings: \nAs well as a higher benefit based on your spouse's earnings , it will also affect your benefits as a spouse, widow, or widower. To get a more accurate estimate of how the government pension you will receive for work not covered by Social Security will affect the part of your benefit based on your spouse's work : Enter the estimated \" gross \" monthly amount of the government pension in today's dollars you will receive for work not covered by Social Security in Step #1 of \" Calculate Your Benefits. \" Use your most recent estimate to determine your estimated retirement benefit based on your own earnings. Subtract the estimated amount of your retirement benefit from the estimated amount of your spouse's, widow's, or widower's benefit before GPO. Enter that amount in Step #2 of \" Calculate Your Benefits \" and select \" Compute. \" The amount in #3 of \" Calculate Your Benefits \" is your estimated spouse's, widow's, or widower's benefit after GPO is applied. Add that figure to the estimated amount of your retirement benefit to find your total estimated monthly benefit. \n\nIf you retire before full retirement age: \nYour benefit amount as a spouse will be reduced. (The reduction will vary based on your date of birth. The maximum reduction for benefits starting at age 62 is 30 percent for someone born in 1946.

                  "Remember , Medicare usually starts when you reach age 65. If you decide to delay starting your benefits , be sure to contact Social Security about 3 months before you turn age 65 to check about applying for Medicare. Even if you have health insurance through a current or former employer or as part of yourseverance package , you should still check to see whether you need to sign up for Medicare. Some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. If you need to sign up for Medicare but you do not , your Medicare coverage may be delayed and cost more. Please read the general and special enrollment period information on page 12 of our Medicare booklet to find out what may happen if you delay. If you are eligible on another record , you may have additional options : If you qualify for benefits as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse on another record , you may choose to apply for survivors benefits now and delay your retirement benefit until later. If you delay receiving your retirement benefit until your full retirement age or later , your retirement benefit will be higher. If you were born before January 2 , 1954 and have already reached your full retirement age, and are eligible for a spouse s or divorced - spouse s benefit and your own retirement benefit , you can choose to receive only the spouse s benefit and delay receiving your retirement benefit until a later date. If your birthday is January 2 , 1954 or later , the option to take only one benefit at full retirement age no longer exists. If you file for one benefit , you will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits. If you don't need your benefits immediately , you may decide to : Wait beyond full retirement age to receive delayed retirement credits. Reminder: If you are within 4 months of age 65, or older, and you have health insurance through an employer or former employer , you should check to see whether you need to sign up for Medicare. Some health insurance plans change",
                  "credits. Reminder: If you are within 4 months of age 65, or older, and you have health insurance through an employer or former employer , you should check to see whether you need to sign up for Medicare. Some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. Choose early retirement and increase the value of your benefits by investing them instead of spending them. Reminder: If you're receiving early retirement from your employer , keep in mind that some company pensions include a Social Security - equivalent supplement that stops automatically at age 62. The supplement stops because they assume you will apply for your retirement benefits at age 62. If your spouse or minor or disabled children will also qualify for benefits from your record , the value of their benefits, added to your own, may help you decide if taking your benefits sooner is your best choice. If your spouse or ex - spouse s date of birth is January 2 , 1954 or later and they become eligible to receive a higher benefit on your record while receiving retirement benefits , they can no longer delay filing for the additional benefit. If your spouse files for one benefit , they will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits. However , when you start your retirement benefits also affects the amount your surviving spouse may receive. If you start your benefits : before full retirement age , we cannot pay your surviving spouse the full benefit amount from your record. Generally , if you were receiving reduced benefits , we base the survivors benefit on that amount. after full retirement age , your surviving spouse may receive your full benefit amount plus any accumulated delayed retirement credits. Accidents or unexpected changes in your circumstances can't be ruled out, of course , so your final decision may be based on your \" best guess \" about your future.",
                  "think about retirement , be sure to plan for the long term. A man who turned 65 in 2014 can expect to live about another 19.3 years. A woman who turned 65 the same year can expect to live about another 21.6 years. And those are just averages. About one out of every four 65-year - olds today will live past age 90. One out of 10 will live past age 95. How long do you expect to live? Did your parents and grandparents all live into their 80s or 90s? If the answer is yes, and you have every reason to believe you will too , you may want to delay starting your benefits until full retirement age or later. If they didn't , you may choose to start receiving retirement benefits earlier. If you come from a long - lived family , you may need the extra money more in later years, particularly if you may outlive pensions or annuities with limits on how long they are paid. If you are not in good health , you may decide to start your benefits earlier. If you stop working , not only will you lose your paycheck , but you may also lose valuable employer provided health insurance. Although there are exceptions , most people will not be covered by Medicare until they reach age 65. Your employer should be able to tell you if you will have retiree health benefits or if you can temporarily extend your health insurance coverage after you retire. Also , if you are married and your spouse is employed , you may be able to switch to their health insurance.",
                  "Should I apply for Medicare?",
                  "What Is The Best Age To Start Your Benefits? The answer is that there is no one \" best age \" for everyone and, ultimately, it is your choice. You should make an informed decision about when to apply for benefits based on your individual and family circumstances. Your monthly benefit amount can differ substantially based on the age when you start receiving benefits. If you decide to start benefits : before your full retirement age , your benefit will be smaller but you will receive it for a longer period of time. at your full retirement age or later , you will receive a larger monthly benefit for a shorter period of time. The amount you receive when you first get benefits sets the base for the amount you will receive for the rest of your life. You may want to consider the following when you make that decision : If you plan to continue working , there are limits on how much you can earn each year between age 62 and full retirement age and still get all your benefits. Depending on the amount of your benefit and your earnings for the year , you may have to give up some of your benefits. If your earnings will be high , you may decide to wait until full retirement age to start your benefits. Once you reach full retirement age , there is no limit on how much you can earn. Reminders : After you reach full retirement age , we recalculate your benefit amount to give you credit for any months in which you did not receive a benefit because of your earnings. When additional earnings appear on your record , we check whether they will increase your monthly benefit. If they do , we will send you a letter telling you your new benefit amount. You can apply for just Medicare at age 65 and start receiving retirement benefits later. When you think about retirement , be sure to plan for the long term. A man who turned 65 in 2014 can expect to live about another 19.3 years. A woman who turned 65 the same year can expect to live about another"

                  "When you start receiving disability benefits , certain members of your family may also qualify for benefits on your record. Benefits may be paid to your : spouse; divorced spouse ; children; disabled child ; and adult child disabled before age 22. If any of your qualified family members apply for benefits , we will ask for their Social Security numbers and their birth certificates. If your spouse is applying for benefits , we may also ask for proof of marriage and dates of prior marriages, if applicable. \n\nMaximum Family Amount \nEach family member may be eligible for a monthly benefit of up to 50 percent of your disability benefit amount. However , there is a limit to the amount we can pay your family. The total depends on your benefit amount and the number of family members who also qualify on your record. The total varies , but generally the total amount you and your family can receive is between 150 and 180 percent of your disability benefit. If the sum of the benefits payable on your account is greater than the family limit , the benefits to the family members will be reduced proportionately. Your benefit will not be affected. \n\nBenefits For Your Spouse \nWhen benefits are payable to your spouse : Age 62 or older , unless he or she collects a higher Social Security benefit based on his or her earnings record. The spouse benefit amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months until his or her full retirement age. At any age if he or she is caring for your child under age 16 or disabled. Your spouse would receive these benefits until the child reaches age 16. At that time, the child's benefits continue , but your spouse's benefits stop unless he or she is old enough to receive retirement benefits age 62 or older or survivor benefits as a widow or widower age 60.",
                  "If Your Spouse Also Worked Under Social Security \nIf your spouse is eligible for retirement benefits on his or her own record , we will always pay that amount first. But if the spouse benefit that is payable on your record is a higher amount , he or she will get a combination of benefits that equals that higher amount. If your spouse will also receive a pension based on work not covered by Social Security, such as government or foreign work , his or her Social Security benefit on your record may be affected. \n\nBenefits For Your Divorced Spouse \nIf you are divorced, even if you have remarried , your ex - spouse may qualify for benefits on your record. If your ex - spouse will also receive a pension based on work not covered by Social Security, such as government or foreign work, his or her Social Security benefit on your record may be affected. To qualify on your record , your ex - spouse must : have been married to you for at least 10 years ; be at least 62 years old ; be unmarried ; and not be eligible for an equal or higher benefit on his or her own Social Security record, or on someone else's Social Security record."

Some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. Choose early retirement and increase the value of your benefits by investing them instead of spending them. Reminder: If you're receiving early retirement from your employer , keep in mind that some company pensions include a Social Security - equivalent supplement that stops automatically at age 62. The supplement stops because they assume you will apply for your retirement benefits at age 62.

                  "Remember , Medicare usually starts when you reach age 65. If you decide to delay starting your benefits , be sure to contact Social Security about 3 months before you turn age 65 to check about applying for Medicare. Even if you have health insurance through a current or former employer or as part of yourseverance package , you should still check to see whether you need to sign up for Medicare. Some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. If you need to sign up for Medicare but you do not , your Medicare coverage may be delayed and cost more. Please read the general and special enrollment period information on page 12 of our Medicare booklet to find out what may happen if you delay. If you are eligible on another record , you may have additional options : If you qualify for benefits as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse on another record , you may choose to apply for survivors benefits now and delay your retirement benefit until later.

A woman who turned 65 the same year can expect to live about another 21.6 years. And those are just averages. About one out of every four 65-year - olds today will live past age 90. One out of 10 will live past age 95. How long do you expect to live? Did your parents and grandparents all live into their 80s or 90s?

If you are not in good health , you may decide to start your benefits earlier.

                  "What Is The Best Age To Start Your Benefits? The answer is that there is no one \" best age \" for everyone and, ultimately, it is your choice. You should make an informed decision about when to apply for benefits based on your individual and family circumstances. Your monthly benefit amount can differ substantially based on the age when you start receiving benefits. If you decide to start benefits : before your full retirement age , your benefit will be smaller but you will receive it for a longer period of time. at your full retirement age or later , you will receive a larger monthly benefit for a shorter period of time. The amount you receive when you first get benefits sets the base for the amount you will receive for the rest of your life. You may want to consider the following when you make that decision : If you plan to continue working , there are limits on how much you can earn each year between age 62 and full retirement age and still get all your benefits. Depending on the amount of your benefit and your earnings for the year , you may have to give up some of your benefits. If your earnings will be high , you may decide to wait until full retirement age to start your benefits. Once you reach full retirement age , there is no limit on how much you can earn. Reminders : After you reach full retirement age , we recalculate your benefit amount to give you credit for any months in which you did not receive a benefit because of your earnings. When additional earnings appear on your record , we check whether they will increase your monthly benefit. If they do , we will send you a letter telling you your new benefit amount. You can apply for just Medicare at age 65 and start receiving retirement benefits later. When you think about retirement , be sure to plan for the long term.

Please keep in mind that these are just estimates. Estimate Your Retirement Benefits We can t provide your actual benefit amount until you apply for benefits. And that amount may differ from the estimates provided because : Your earnings may increase or decrease in the future. After you start receiving benefits , they will be adjusted for cost - of - living increases. Your estimated benefits are based on current law. The law governing benefit amounts may change because, by 2035, the combined trust fund reserves are projected to become depleted one year later than projected last year. Payroll taxes collected will be enough to pay only about 80 cents for each dollar of scheduled benefits. Your benefit amount may be affected by military service, railroad employment or pensions earned through work on which you did not pay Social Security tax. \n\nWho Can Use the Retirement Estimator \nYou can use the Retirement Estimator if : You have enough Social Security credits at this time to qualify for benefits and You are not : Currently receiving benefits on your own Social Security record ; Waiting for a decision about your application for benefits or Medicare ; Age 62 or older and receiving benefits on another Social Security record ; or Eligible for a Pension Based on Work Not Covered By Social Security.

                  "Maximum Family Benefits \nIf one of your spouse's children also qualifies for benefits , there is a limit to the amount we can pay family members. The total depends on your spouse's benefit amount and the number of family members who also qualify on the same record. The total varies , but generally the total amount the worker your spouse and their family members can receive is about 150 to 180 percent of the worker's full retirement benefit. \n\nHow Do I Apply? \nYou can apply : Online - Use our Social Security Retirement / Medicare Benefit Application to apply for retirement, spouse's, divorced spouse's or Medicare benefits. If your spouse is already receiving benefits when you apply , or if you and your spouse apply at the same time , we will also check your eligibility for benefits as a spouse. If you qualify , your application will automatically serve as a request for spousal benefits. By phone - Call us at 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213. If you are deaf or hard of hearing , you can call us at TTY 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778. In person - Visit your local Social Security office. Call first to make an appointment. If you do not live in the U.S. or one of its territories you can also - Contact the nearest U.S. Social Security office, U.S. Embassy or consulate. \n\nNext Steps \nEven if you do not qualify for benefits on someone else's record , some members of your family may qualify for benefits on your record. If you: are interested in information about benefits for your family, go to \" Benefits For Your Family. \" never married or had children , go to \" How You Apply For Retirement Benefits Or Medicare. \"",
                  "How Much Will I Receive? \nIf you qualify and apply for your own retirement benefits and for benefits as a spouse , we always pay your own benefits first. If your benefits as a spouse are higher than your own retirement benefits , you will get a combination of benefits equaling the higher spouse benefit. If you begin receiving benefits : between age 62 and your full retirement age , the amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months up to your full retirement age. If you are under full retirement age and you continue to work while receiving benefits , your benefits may be affected by the retirement earnings test. at your full retirement age , your benefit as a spouse cannot exceed one - half of your spouse's full retirement amount. If you were born before January 2 , 1954 and have already reached full retirement age , you can choose to receive only the spouse s benefit and delay receiving your retirement benefit until a later date. If your spouse is full retirement age and applying for spouse s benefits only , they can apply online by using the retirement application. Your spouse can also contact us to schedule an appointment. If your spouse s birthday is January 2 , 1954 or later , the option to take only one benefit at full retirement age no longer exists. If your spouse files for one benefit , they will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits. If you will receive a pension for work not covered by Social Security such as government employment , the amount of your Social Security benefits on your spouse's record may be reduced. Benefits paid to you as a spouse will not decrease your spouse s retirement benefit. In fact , the value of the benefits you may receive, added to their benefits, may help your spouse decide if taking benefits sooner may be more advantageous.",

Social Security benefits are paid in the month following the month for which they're due. This means that the benefit due for December would be paid to you in January 2019, and so on. \n\nHow Much You Will Receive \nThe amount of your monthly disability benefit is based on your lifetime average earnings covered by Social Security. If you don't already have an estimate , you can get your online with your personal my Social Security account or use our Benefit Calculators to determine how much you would get if you became disabled right now. \n\nOther Payments May Affect Your Disability Benefits \nIf you receive certain other government benefits, such as workers' compensation, public disability benefits, or pensions based on work not covered by Social Security for example, some government or foreign employment, the Social Security benefits payable to you and your family may be reduced. For more information about how these benefits can affect your Social Security payments , refer to the following publications : How Workers' Compensation And Other Disability Payments May Affect Your Benefit ; Windfall Elimination Provision ; or Government Pension Offset.

But your chances of becoming disabled are probably greater than you realize. Studies show that just over one in four of today's 20-year - olds will become disabled before reaching age 67. While we spend a lot of time working to succeed in our jobs and careers , few of us think about ensuring that we have a safety net to fall back on should we become disabled. This is an area where Social Security can provide valuable help to you. This disability planner helps you find out : how you can qualify and apply for benefits ; what happens if your application is approved ; who can receive benefits on your earnings record ; what you need to know about receiving disability benefits ; when Medicare coverage starts for Social Security disability beneficiaries ; and what happens if you go back to work. \n\nDisability and Supplemental Security Income \nWe pay disability benefits under two programs : The Social Security disability insurance program pays benefits to you and certain family members if you worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes. Your adult child also may qualify for benefits on your earnings record if he or she has a disability that started before age 22. The Supplemental Security Income SSI program pays benefits to disabled adults and children who have limited income and resources.

If an email address does not end in .gov , use caution before opening attachments or clicking on pictures or links in the email. Currently , Social Security sends emails from no-reply@ssa.gov, subscription.service@subscriptions.ssa.gov and ThankYou@ssa.gov. In a few instances , we use marketing firms to raise awareness of Social Security s online services , and this includes creating a my Social Security account. We allow these firms to send email directly to individuals. Any links you find within these emails should always point to a .gov/ web address. Links, logos, or pictures in the body of an official Social Security email will always direct you to an official Social Security website. Rather than relying on the way a link looks , please follow these steps to confirm a link s authenticity : To verify the web address of a link or picture , hover over it with your mouse until a text box appears with the web address. This is the actual address you will be directed to and it should always end in .gov/ A forward slash should always follow the .gov domain. Example - https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/ Links to the official Social Security website will always begin with https://www.socialsecurity.gov/ or https://secure.ssa.gov/.

Once you give us this additional information , we will send you a letter in the mail in five to 10 business days. You will need this letter to complete the voluntary process to add extra security.

                  "Adults Disabled Before Age 22 \nAn adult disabled before age 22 may be eligible for child's benefits if a parent is deceased or starts receiving retirement or disability benefits. We consider this a \" child's \" benefit because it is paid on a parent's Social Security earnings record. The \" adult child \" including an adopted child, or, in some cases, a stepchild, grandchild, or step grandchild must be unmarried, age 18 or older, have a disability that started before age 22, and meet the definition of disability for adults. It is not necessary that the adult child ever worked. Benefits are paid based on the parent's earnings record. An adult child must not have substantial earnings. The amount of earnings we consider \" substantial \" increases each year. In 2019 , this means working and earning more than $1,220 a month. \n\nWhat if the adult child is already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record? \nAn adult child already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record should still check to see if benefits may be payable on a parent's earnings record. Higher benefits might be payable and entitlement to Medicare may be possible. \n\nHow do we decide if an adult \"child\" is disabled for SSDI benefits? \nIf a child is age 18 or older , we will evaluate his or her disability the same way we would evaluate the disability for any adult. We send the application to the Disability Determination Services in your state that completes the disability decision for us.",
                  "What We Mean By Disability \nThe definition of disability under Social Security is different than other programs. Social Security pays only for total disability. No benefits are payable for partial disability or for short - term disability. We consider you disabled under Social Security rules if : You cannot do work that you did before ; We decide that you cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition ; and Your disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death. This is a strict definition of disability. Social Security program rules assume that working families have access to other resources to provide support during periods of short - term disabilities, including workers' compensation, insurance, savings, and investments. \n\nHow We Decide If You Are Disabled \nIf you have enough work to qualify for disability benefits , we use a step - by - step process involving five questions. They are: \n\n1. Are you working? \nIf you are working in 2019 and your earnings average more than $1,220 a month , you generally cannot be considered disabled. If you are not working , we will send your application to the Disability Determination Services DDS office that will make the decision about your medical condition. The DDS uses Steps 2 - 5 below to make the decision. \n\n2. Is your condition \"severe\"? \nYour condition must significantly limit your ability to do basic work such as lifting, standing, walking, sitting, and remembering for at least 12 months. If it does not , we will find that you are not disabled. If your condition does interfere with basic work - related activities , we go to Step 3.",
                  "To qualify for Social Security disability benefits , you must first have worked in jobs covered by Social Security. Then you must have a medical condition that meets Social Security's definition of disability. In general , we pay monthly benefits to people who are unable to work for a year or more because of a disability. Benefits usually continue until you are able to work again on a regular basis. There are also a number of special rules, called \" work incentives, \" that provide continued benefits and health care coverage to help you make the transition back to work. If you are receiving Social Security disability benefits when you reach full retirement age, your disability benefits automatically convert to retirement benefits , but the amount remains the same. \n\nHow Much Work Do You Need? \nIn addition to meeting our definition of disability , you must have worked long enough and recently enough under Social Security to qualify for disability benefits. Social Security work credits are based on your total yearly wages or self - employment income. You can earn up to four credits each year. The amount needed for a work credit changes from year to year. In 2019 , for example , you earn one credit for each $1,360 in wages or self - employment income. When you've earned $5,440 , you've earned your four credits for the year. The number of work credits you need to qualify for disability benefits depends on your age when you become disabled. Generally , you need 40 credits , 20 of which were earned in the last 10 years ending with the year you become disabled. However , younger workers may qualify with fewer credits. For more information on whether you qualify , read our publication ; How You Earn Credits.",

                  "Adults Disabled Before Age 22 \nAn adult disabled before age 22 may be eligible for child's benefits if a parent is deceased or starts receiving retirement or disability benefits. We consider this a \" child's \" benefit because it is paid on a parent's Social Security earnings record. The \" adult child \" including an adopted child, or, in some cases, a stepchild, grandchild, or step grandchild must be unmarried, age 18 or older, have a disability that started before age 22, and meet the definition of disability for adults. It is not necessary that the adult child ever worked. Benefits are paid based on the parent's earnings record. An adult child must not have substantial earnings. The amount of earnings we consider \" substantial \" increases each year. In 2019 , this means working and earning more than $1,220 a month. \n\nWhat if the adult child is already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record? \nAn adult child already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record should still check to see if benefits may be payable on a parent's earnings record. Higher benefits might be payable and entitlement to Medicare may be possible. \n\nHow do we decide if an adult \"child\" is disabled for SSDI benefits? \nIf a child is age 18 or older , we will evaluate his or her disability the same way we would evaluate the disability for any adult. We send the application to the Disability Determination Services in your state that completes the disability decision for us.",
                  "What We Mean By Disability \nThe definition of disability under Social Security is different than other programs. Social Security pays only for total disability. No benefits are payable for partial disability or for short - term disability. We consider you disabled under Social Security rules if : You cannot do work that you did before ; We decide that you cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition ; and Your disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death. This is a strict definition of disability. Social Security program rules assume that working families have access to other resources to provide support during periods of short - term disabilities, including workers' compensation, insurance, savings, and investments. \n\nHow We Decide If You Are Disabled \nIf you have enough work to qualify for disability benefits , we use a step - by - step process involving five questions. They are: \n\n1. Are you working? \nIf you are working in 2019 and your earnings average more than $1,220 a month , you generally cannot be considered disabled. If you are not working , we will send your application to the Disability Determination Services DDS office that will make the decision about your medical condition. The DDS uses Steps 2 - 5 below to make the decision. \n\n2. Is your condition \"severe\"? \nYour condition must significantly limit your ability to do basic work such as lifting, standing, walking, sitting, and remembering for at least 12 months. If it does not , we will find that you are not disabled. If your condition does interfere with basic work - related activities , we go to Step 3.",
                  "3. Is your condition found in the list of disabling conditions? \nFor each of the major body systems , we maintain a list of medical conditions that we consider so severe that it prevents a person from completing substantial gainful activity. If your condition is not on the list , we have to decide if it is as severe as a medical condition that is on the list. If it is , we will find that you are disabled.

                  "Special Situations \nMost people who receive disability benefits are workers who qualify on their own records and meet the work and disability requirements we have just described. However , there are some situations you may not know about : If You're Blind Or Have Low Vision - How We Can Help If You Are The Worker's Widow Or Widower Benefits For A Disabled Child Benefits for Wounded Warriors & Veterans \n\nSpecial Rules For People Who Are Blind Or Have Low Vision \nWe consider you to be legally blind under Social Security rules if your vision cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 in your better eye or if your visual field is 20 degrees or less, even with a corrective lens. Many people who meet the legal definition of blindness still have some sight and may be able to read large print and get around without a cane or a guide dog. If you do not meet the legal definition of blindness , you may still qualify for disability benefits if your vision problems alone or combined with other health problems prevent you from working. There are a number of special rules for people who are blind that recognize the severe impact of blindness on a person's ability to work. For example , the monthly earnings limit for people who are blind is generally higher than the limit that applies to non - blind disabled workers. In 2019 , the monthly earnings limit is $2,040."

                  "Survivors Benefit Amount \nYour survivors benefit amount is based on the earnings of the person who died. The more they paid into Social Security , the higher your benefits would be. The monthly amount you would get is a percentage of the deceased's basic Social Security benefit. It depends on your age and the type of benefit you are eligible to receive. If the person who died was receiving reduced benefits , we base your survivors benefit on that amount. These are examples of the benefits that survivors may receive : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of the deceased worker's benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of the deceased worker's basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower aged 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Dependent parent of the deceased worker, age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent. Two surviving parents 75 percent to each parent. Percentages for a surviving divorced spouse would be the same as above. There may also be a special lump - sum death benefit. \n\nMaximum Family Amount \nThere's a limit to the amount that family members can receive each month. The limit varies , but it is generally equal to between 150 and 180 percent of the basic benefit rate. If the sum of the benefits payable to family members is greater than this limit , the benefits will be reduced proportionately. Any benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse based on disability or age won't count toward this maximum amount.",

Benefits paid to you as a surviving divorced spouse won't affect the benefit amount for other survivors getting benefits on the worker's record. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , the remarriage will not affect your eligibility for survivors benefits. If you are caring for a child under age 16 or disabled and gets benefits on the record of your former spouse , you would not have to meet the length - of - marriage rule. The child must be your former spouse's natural or legally adopted child. \n\nMinor Or Disabled Child \nIf you are the unmarried child under 18 up to age 19 if attending elementary or secondary school full time of a worker who dies , you can be eligible to receive Social Security survivors benefits. And you can get benefits at any age if you were disabled before age 22 and remain disabled. Besides the worker's natural children , their stepchildren, grandchildren, or adopted children may receive benefits under certain circumstances. \n\nFor Your Parents \nIf you are the dependent parent , who is at least age 62 , of a worker who dies , you may be eligible to receive Social Security survivors benefits. You must have been receiving at least half of your support from your working child and you must not be eligible to receive a retirement benefit that is higher than the benefit we could pay on your child s record. Generally, you must not have married after your deceased adult child s death ; however, there are some exceptions.

In 2019 , for example , your spouse can earn one credit for each $1,360 of wages or self - employment income. When your spouse has earned $5,440 , they have earned their four credits for the year. The number of credits needed to provide benefits for survivors depends on the worker's age when they die. No one needs more than 40 credits 10 years of work to be eligible for any Social Security benefit. But , the younger a person is , the fewer credits they must have for family members to receive survivors benefits. Benefits can be paid to the worker's children and the surviving spouse who is caring for the children even if the worker doesn't have the required number of credits. They can get benefits if the worker has credit for one and one - half years of work 6 credits in the three years just before their death.

Benefits for a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse may be affected by several additional factors : If you remarry before you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you cannot receive benefits as a surviving spouse while you are married. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you will continue to qualify for benefits on your deceased spouse's Social Security record. If you receive benefits as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse , you can switch to your own retirement benefit as early as age 62. This assumes you are eligible for retirement benefits and your retirement rate is higher than your rate as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse. In many cases , a widow or widower can begin receiving one benefit at a reduced rate and then, at full retirement age, switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate. If you will also receive a pension based on work not covered by Social Security, such as government or foreign work , your Social Security benefits as a survivor may be affected.",

                  "Special Situations \nMost people who receive disability benefits are workers who qualify on their own records and meet the work and disability requirements we have just described. However , there are some situations you may not know about : If You're Blind Or Have Low Vision - How We Can Help If You Are The Worker's Widow Or Widower Benefits For A Disabled Child Benefits for Wounded Warriors & Veterans \n\nSpecial Rules For People Who Are Blind Or Have Low Vision \nWe consider you to be legally blind under Social Security rules if your vision cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 in your better eye or if your visual field is 20 degrees or less, even with a corrective lens. Many people who meet the legal definition of blindness still have some sight and may be able to read large print and get around without a cane or a guide dog. If you do not meet the legal definition of blindness , you may still qualify for disability benefits if your vision problems alone or combined with other health problems prevent you from working. There are a number of special rules for people who are blind that recognize the severe impact of blindness on a person's ability to work. For example , the monthly earnings limit for people who are blind is generally higher than the limit that applies to non - blind disabled workers. In 2019 , the monthly earnings limit is $2,040.",
                  "What We Mean By Disability \nThe definition of disability under Social Security is different than other programs. Social Security pays only for total disability. No benefits are payable for partial disability or for short - term disability. We consider you disabled under Social Security rules if : You cannot do work that you did before ; We decide that you cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition ; and Your disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death. This is a strict definition of disability. Social Security program rules assume that working families have access to other resources to provide support during periods of short - term disabilities, including workers' compensation, insurance, savings, and investments. \n\nHow We Decide If You Are Disabled \nIf you have enough work to qualify for disability benefits , we use a step - by - step process involving five questions. They are: \n\n1. Are you working? \nIf you are working in 2019 and your earnings average more than $1,220 a month , you generally cannot be considered disabled. If you are not working , we will send your application to the Disability Determination Services DDS office that will make the decision about your medical condition. The DDS uses Steps 2 - 5 below to make the decision. \n\n2. Is your condition \"severe\"? \nYour condition must significantly limit your ability to do basic work such as lifting, standing, walking, sitting, and remembering for at least 12 months. If it does not , we will find that you are not disabled. If your condition does interfere with basic work - related activities , we go to Step 3.",
                  "3. Is your condition found in the list of disabling conditions? \nFor each of the major body systems , we maintain a list of medical conditions that we consider so severe that it prevents a person from completing substantial gainful activity. If your condition is not on the list , we have to decide if it is as severe as a medical condition that is on the list. If it is , we will find that you are disabled. If it is not , we then go to Step 4. We have two initiatives designed to expedite our processing of new disability claims : Compassionate Allowances : Certain cases that usually qualify for disability can be allowed as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. Examples include acute leukemia, Lou Gehrig s disease ALS, and pancreatic cancer. Quick Disability Determinations : We use sophisticated computer screening to identify cases with a high probability of allowance. For more information about our disability claims process , visit our Benefits For People With Disabilities website. \n\n4. Can you do the work you did previously? \nAt this step , we decide if your medical impairment prevents you from performing any of your past work. It is doesn t, we ll decide you don t have a qualifying disability. If it does , we proceed to Step 5. \n\n5. Can you do any other type of work? \nIf you can t do the work you did in the past , we look to see if there is other work you could do despite your impairment. We consider your medical conditions and your age, education, past work experience, and any transferable skills you may have. If you can t do other work , we ll decide you are disabled. If you can do other work , we ll decide that you don t have a qualifying disability and your claim will be denied.",
                  "Benefits Planner: Disability | How You Qualify \nTo qualify for Social Security disability benefits , you must first have worked in jobs covered by Social Security. Then you must have a medical condition that meets Social Security's definition of disability. In general , we pay monthly benefits to people who are unable to work for a year or more because of a disability. Benefits usually continue until you are able to work again on a regular basis. There are also a number of special rules, called \" work incentives, \" that provide continued benefits and health care coverage to help you make the transition back to work. If you are receiving Social Security disability benefits when you reach full retirement age, your disability benefits automatically convert to retirement benefits , but the amount remains the same. \n\nHow Much Work Do You Need? \nIn addition to meeting our definition of disability , you must have worked long enough and recently enough under Social Security to qualify for disability benefits. Social Security work credits are based on your total yearly wages or self - employment income. You can earn up to four credits each year. The amount needed for a work credit changes from year to year. In 2019 , for example , you earn one credit for each $1,360 in wages or self - employment income. When you've earned $5,440 , you've earned your four credits for the year. The number of work credits you need to qualify for disability benefits depends on your age when you become disabled. Generally , you need 40 credits , 20 of which were earned in the last 10 years ending with the year you become disabled. However , younger workers may qualify with fewer credits. For more information on whether you qualify , read our publication ; How You Earn Credits.",
                  "Adults Disabled Before Age 22 \nAn adult disabled before age 22 may be eligible for child's benefits if a parent is deceased or starts receiving retirement or disability benefits. We consider this a \" child's \" benefit because it is paid on a parent's Social Security earnings record. The \" adult child \" including an adopted child, or, in some cases, a stepchild, grandchild, or step grandchild must be unmarried, age 18 or older, have a disability that started before age 22, and meet the definition of disability for adults. It is not necessary that the adult child ever worked. Benefits are paid based on the parent's earnings record. An adult child must not have substantial earnings. The amount of earnings we consider \" substantial \" increases each year. In 2019 , this means working and earning more than $1,220 a month. \n\nWhat if the adult child is already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record? \nAn adult child already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record should still check to see if benefits may be payable on a parent's earnings record. Higher benefits might be payable and entitlement to Medicare may be possible. \n\nHow do we decide if an adult \"child\" is disabled for SSDI benefits? \nIf a child is age 18 or older , we will evaluate his or her disability the same way we would evaluate the disability for any adult. We send the application to the Disability Determination Services in your state that completes the disability decision for us."

                  "Widow Or Widower \nIf you are the widow or widower of a person who worked long enough under Social Security , you can : receive full benefits at full retirement age for survivors or reduced benefits as early as age 60. begin receiving benefits as early as age 50 if you are disabled and the disability started before or within seven years of the worker's death. receive survivors benefits at any age , if you have not remarried and you take care of the deceased worker's child who is under age 16 or is disabled and receives benefits on the worker's record. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , your remarriage will not affect your eligibility for survivors benefits. A widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse cannot apply online for survivors benefits. You should contact Social Security at 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213 to request an appointment. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, call our TTY number at 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778. If you wish to apply for disability benefits as a survivor , you can speed up the disability application process if you complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of your appointment. We use the same definition of disability for widows and widowers as we do for workers. \n\nA few other situations: \nIf you already receive benefits as a spouse , your benefit will automatically convert to survivors benefits after we receive the report of death. If you are also eligible for retirement benefits but haven't applied yet , you have an additional option. You can apply for retirement or survivors benefits now and switch to the other higher benefit at a later date. For those already receiving retirement benefits , you can only apply for benefits as a widow or widower if the retirement benefit you receive is less than the benefits you would receive as a survivor.",
                  "Other Things You Need To Know \nThere are limits on how much survivors may earn while they receive benefits. Benefits for a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse may be affected by several additional factors : If you remarry before you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you cannot receive benefits as a surviving spouse while you are married. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you will continue to qualify for benefits on your deceased spouse's Social Security record. If you receive benefits as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse , you can switch to your own retirement benefit as early as age 62. This assumes you are eligible for retirement benefits and your retirement rate is higher than your rate as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse. In many cases , a widow or widower can begin receiving one benefit at a reduced rate and then, at full retirement age, switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate. If you will also receive a pension based on work not covered by Social Security, such as government or foreign work , your Social Security benefits as a survivor may be affected.",
                  "Benefits Planner: Survivors | If You Are The Survivor \nJust as you plan for your family's protection if you die , you should consider the Social Security benefits that may be available if you are the survivor that is, the spouse, child, or parent of a worker who dies. That person must have worked long enough under Social Security to qualify for benefits. \n\nHow Your Spouse Earns Social Security Survivors Benefits \nA worker can earn up to four credits each year. In 2019 , for example , your spouse can earn one credit for each $1,360 of wages or self - employment income. When your spouse has earned $5,440 , they have earned their four credits for the year. The number of credits needed to provide benefits for survivors depends on the worker's age when they die. No one needs more than 40 credits 10 years of work to be eligible for any Social Security benefit. But , the younger a person is , the fewer credits they must have for family members to receive survivors benefits. Benefits can be paid to the worker's children and the surviving spouse who is caring for the children even if the worker doesn't have the required number of credits. They can get benefits if the worker has credit for one and one - half years of work 6 credits in the three years just before their death. Each person s situation is different and you need to talk to a Social Security claims representative about your choices.",
                  "Survivors Benefit Amount \nYour survivors benefit amount is based on the earnings of the person who died. The more they paid into Social Security , the higher your benefits would be. The monthly amount you would get is a percentage of the deceased's basic Social Security benefit. It depends on your age and the type of benefit you are eligible to receive. If the person who died was receiving reduced benefits , we base your survivors benefit on that amount. These are examples of the benefits that survivors may receive : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of the deceased worker's benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of the deceased worker's basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower aged 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Dependent parent of the deceased worker, age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent. Two surviving parents 75 percent to each parent. Percentages for a surviving divorced spouse would be the same as above. There may also be a special lump - sum death benefit. \n\nMaximum Family Amount \nThere's a limit to the amount that family members can receive each month. The limit varies , but it is generally equal to between 150 and 180 percent of the basic benefit rate. If the sum of the benefits payable to family members is greater than this limit , the benefits will be reduced proportionately. Any benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse based on disability or age won't count toward this maximum amount.",
                  "Surviving Divorced Spouse \nIf you are the divorced spouse of a worker who dies , you could get benefits the same as a widow or widower, provided that your marriage lasted 10 years or more. Benefits paid to you as a surviving divorced spouse won't affect the benefit amount for other survivors getting benefits on the worker's record. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , the remarriage will not affect your eligibility for survivors benefits. If you are caring for a child under age 16 or disabled and gets benefits on the record of your former spouse , you would not have to meet the length - of - marriage rule. The child must be your former spouse's natural or legally adopted child. \n\nMinor Or Disabled Child \nIf you are the unmarried child under 18 up to age 19 if attending elementary or secondary school full time of a worker who dies , you can be eligible to receive Social Security survivors benefits. And you can get benefits at any age if you were disabled before age 22 and remain disabled. Besides the worker's natural children , their stepchildren, grandchildren, or adopted children may receive benefits under certain circumstances. \n\nFor Your Parents \nIf you are the dependent parent , who is at least age 62 , of a worker who dies , you may be eligible to receive Social Security survivors benefits. You must have been receiving at least half of your support from your working child and you must not be eligible to receive a retirement benefit that is higher than the benefit we could pay on your child s record. Generally, you must not have married after your deceased adult child s death ; however, there are some exceptions. Besides being the natural parent , you could also be the stepparent, or the adoptive parent if you became the deceased worker s parent before he or she was age 16."

                  "If you have higher income , you ll pay an additional premium amount for Medicare Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage. We call the additional amount the income - related monthly adjustment amount. Here s how it works : Part B helps pay for your doctors services and outpatient care. It also covers other medical services, such as physical and occupational therapy, and some home health care. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a substantial portion about 75 percent of the Part B premium , and the beneficiary pays the remaining 25 percent. If we determine you re a higher - income beneficiary , you ll pay a larger percentage of the total cost of Part B based on the income you normally report to the Internal Revenue Service IRS. You ll pay monthly Part B premiums equal to 35 , 50 , 65 , 80, or 85 percent of the total cost, depending on what you report to the IRS. Medicare prescription drug coverage helps pay for your prescription drugs. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a major portion of the total costs for this coverage , and the beneficiary pays the rest. Prescription drug plan costs vary depending on the plan, and whether you get the Extra Help, also known as the subsidy, with your portion of the Medicare prescription drug coverage costs. If you re a higher - income beneficiary with Medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay monthly premiums plus an additional amount, which is based on what you report to the IRS. Because individual plan premiums vary , the law specifies that the amount is determined using a base premium. We tie the additional amount you pay to the base beneficiary premium, not your own premium amount. If you re a higher - income beneficiary , we deduct this amount from your monthly Social Security payments regardless of how you usually pay your monthly prescription plan premiums. If the amount is greater than your monthly payment from Social Security, or you don t get monthly payments , you ll get a separate bill from another federal agency, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the",

You or your spouse stopped working or reduced your work hours. You or your spouse lost income - producing property because of a disaster or other event beyond your control. You or your spouse experienced a scheduled cessation, termination, or reorganization of an employer s pension plan. You or your spouse received a settlement from an employer or former employer because of the employer s closure, bankruptcy, or reorganization. If any of the above applies to you , we need to see documentation verifying the event and the reduction in your income. The documentation you provide should relate to the event and may include a death certificate, a letter from your employer about your retirement, or something similar. If you filed a federal income tax return for the year in question , you need to show us your signed copy of the return.

If you must pay higher premiums , we use a sliding scale to calculate the adjustments, based on your modified adjusted gross income MAGI. Your MAGI is your total adjusted gross income and tax - exempt interest income. If you file your taxes as married, filing jointly and your MAGI is greater than $170,000 , you ll pay higher premiums for your Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage. If you file your taxes using a different status, and your MAGI is greater than $85,000 , you ll pay higher premiums. See the chart below, Modified Adjusted Gross Income MAGI, for an idea of what you can expect to pay. If you must pay higher premiums , we ll send you a letter with your premium amount and the reason for our determination. If you have both Medicare Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay higher premiums for each. If you have only one Medicare Part B or Medicare prescription drug coverage you ll pay an income - related monthly adjustment amount only on the benefit you have. If you decide to enroll in the other program later in the same year, and you already are paying an income - related monthly adjustment amount , we ll apply an adjustment automatically to the other program when you enroll. In this case , we won t send you another letter explaining how we made this determination. Remember , if your income isn t greater than the limits described above , this law does not apply to you.",

We call the additional amount the income - related monthly adjustment amount. Here s how it works : Part B helps pay for your doctors services and outpatient care. It also covers other medical services, such as physical and occupational therapy, and some home health care. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a substantial portion about 75 percent of the Part B premium , and the beneficiary pays the remaining 25 percent. If we determine you re a higher - income beneficiary , you ll pay a larger percentage of the total cost of Part B based on the income you normally report to the Internal Revenue Service IRS. You ll pay monthly Part B premiums equal to 35 , 50 , 65 , 80, or 85 percent of the total cost, depending on what you report to the IRS. Medicare prescription drug coverage helps pay for your prescription drugs. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a major portion of the total costs for this coverage , and the beneficiary pays the rest. Prescription drug plan costs vary depending on the plan, and whether you get the Extra Help, also known as the subsidy, with your portion of the Medicare prescription drug coverage costs.

                  "Social Security Credits \nYou must earn at least 40 Social Security credits to qualify for Social Security benefits. You earn Social Security credits when you work and pay Social Security taxes. The number of credits does not affect the amount of benefits you receive. It only determines if you are eligible or not. You do not get extra benefits for earning more than the minimum number of credits. We cannot pay benefits to you if you don t have enough credits. We use the amount of credits you ve earned to determine your eligibility for retirement or disability benefits, as well as your family s eligibility for survivors benefits when you die. \n\nHow Credits Are Earned \nSince 1978 , when you work and pay Social Security taxes , you earn up to a maximum of four credits per year. Credits are based on your total wages and self - employment income for the year. You might work all year to earn four credits , or you might earn enough for all four in much less time. The amount of earnings it takes to earn a credit may change each year. In 2020 , you earn one Social Security or Medicare credit for every $1,410 in covered earnings each year. You must earn $5,640 to get the maximum four credits for the year. During your lifetime , you might earn more credits than the minimum number you need to be eligible for benefits. These extra credits do not increase your benefit amount. The average of your earnings over your working years , not the total number of credits you earn , determines how much your monthly payment will be when you receive benefits.

                  "Number Of Credits Needed For Retirement Benefits \nIf you were born after 1928 , you need 40 credits to qualify for retirement. \n\nNumber Of Credits Needed For Disability Benefits \nTo be eligible for disability benefits , you must meet a recent work test and a duration work test. The number of credits necessary to meet the recent work test depends on your age. The rules are as follows : Before age 24 - You may qualify if you have 6 credits earned in the 3-year period ending when your disability starts. Age 24 to 31 In general , you may qualify if you have credit for working half the time between age 21 and the time you become disabled. As a general example , if you become disabled at age 27 , you would need 3 years of work 12 credits out of the past 6 years between ages 21 and 27. Age 31 or older - In general , you must have at least 20 credits in the 10-year period immediately before you become disabled. The following table shows how many years of work credits you need to meet the duration of work test based on your age when your disability began. For the duration of work test , your work does not have to fall within a certain period. The table only provides an estimate of how many work credits you need. It does not cover all situations. If you are statutorily blind , you must only meet the duration of work test. When statutory blindness is involved , there is not a recent work test requirement. NOTE : This table is an estimate only and does not cover all situations",
                  "Number Of Credits Needed For Survivors Benefits \nThe number of credits needed for family members to be eligible for survivors benefits depends on your age when you die. The younger you are , the fewer credits needed. Nobody needs more than 40 credits. Under a special rule , we can pay benefits to your children and your spouse caring for your children, even if your record doesn't have the number of credits needed. They can get benefits if you have credits for one and one - half year's work 6 credits in the three years before your death. If you are already receiving retirement or disability benefits at the time of your death , we will pay your survivors based on that entitlement. We will not have to determine your credits again."

                  "Number Of Credits Needed For Retirement Benefits \nIf you were born after 1928 , you need 40 credits to qualify for retirement. \n\nNumber Of Credits Needed For Disability Benefits \nTo be eligible for disability benefits , you must meet a recent work test and a duration work test. The number of credits necessary to meet the recent work test depends on your age. The rules are as follows : Before age 24 - You may qualify if you have 6 credits earned in the 3-year period ending when your disability starts. Age 24 to 31 In general , you may qualify if you have credit for working half the time between age 21 and the time you become disabled. As a general example , if you become disabled at age 27 , you would need 3 years of work 12 credits out of the past 6 years between ages 21 and 27. Age 31 or older - In general , you must have at least 20 credits in the 10-year period immediately before you become disabled. The following table shows how many years of work credits you need to meet the duration of work test based on your age when your disability began. For the duration of work test , your work does not have to fall within a certain period. The table only provides an estimate of how many work credits you need. It does not cover all situations. If you are statutorily blind , you must only meet the duration of work test. When statutory blindness is involved , there is not a recent work test requirement. NOTE : This table is an estimate only and does not cover all situations",
                  "Social Security Credits \nYou must earn at least 40 Social Security credits to qualify for Social Security benefits. You earn Social Security credits when you work and pay Social Security taxes. The number of credits does not affect the amount of benefits you receive. It only determines if you are eligible or not. You do not get extra benefits for earning more than the minimum number of credits. We cannot pay benefits to you if you don t have enough credits. We use the amount of credits you ve earned to determine your eligibility for retirement or disability benefits, as well as your family s eligibility for survivors benefits when you die. \n\nHow Credits Are Earned \nSince 1978 , when you work and pay Social Security taxes , you earn up to a maximum of four credits per year. Credits are based on your total wages and self - employment income for the year. You might work all year to earn four credits , or you might earn enough for all four in much less time. The amount of earnings it takes to earn a credit may change each year. In 2020 , you earn one Social Security or Medicare credit for every $1,410 in covered earnings each year. You must earn $5,640 to get the maximum four credits for the year. During your lifetime , you might earn more credits than the minimum number you need to be eligible for benefits. These extra credits do not increase your benefit amount. The average of your earnings over your working years , not the total number of credits you earn , determines how much your monthly payment will be when you receive benefits. Read our publication, \" How You Earn Credits, \" for more information. \n\nNumber Of Credits Needed For Retirement Benefits \nIf you were born after 1928 , you need 40 credits to qualify for retirement.",
                  "Number Of Credits Needed For Survivors Benefits \nThe number of credits needed for family members to be eligible for survivors benefits depends on your age when you die. The younger you are , the fewer credits needed. Nobody needs more than 40 credits. Under a special rule , we can pay benefits to your children and your spouse caring for your children, even if your record doesn't have the number of credits needed. They can get benefits if you have credits for one and one - half year's work 6 credits in the three years before your death. If you are already receiving retirement or disability benefits at the time of your death , we will pay your survivors based on that entitlement. We will not have to determine your credits again."

Special forbearance : This plan gives you some extra time to repay the missed mortgage payments. Loan modification : Sometimes you need a fresh start. This plan lets you add the missed mortgage payments and any related legal costs to your total loan balance. You and your servicer then come up with a new mortgage payment schedule. Extra time to arrange a private sale : If you need to sell your home, this plan lets you delay a foreclosure so you have time to sell. Short sale : If you owe more money than your house is worth , your servicer might agree to a short sale. This means the servicer will accept the total proceeds from the home sale even if it s less than the full amount you owe on the mortgage as full payment of the debt you owe. Deed in lieu of foreclosure : This plan lets you avoid the foreclosure process by signing over the deed to the home to your servicer. The home will then belong to the servicer.

So , for example , if you provide information for the year 2018 , we ll verify it in July of 2019. If the information we receive from the IRS and the SSA shows that you have income above our limits , we ll send a letter notifying you and your spouse or partner if their income is part of your household income.

If you respond by disputing the information in our letter : When we receive your response , we ll assign an income verification case manager to work with you and your representative, if you choose to have one. Your case manager will guide you through the process and help you find any authorized deductions that may reduce your total gross household income below our limits. We try to resolve all cases within 75 days.

That's a requirement from you to Veterans Affairs.\nuser: And everybody has to pass through that exam in order to get their claims?\nagent: Not everyone. That exam is required in case your medical information isn't clear enough to us to decide about your claim.\nuser: But if i have, well you know, enough information about my condition, I won't be required to do the exam, right?\nagent: That's correct. In case, your medical profile has enough information, the exam won't be necessary on any instance. That's why your medical information must be as complete as possible.\nuser: I'm sure i won't need that, but it's good to know what it is. Could you tell me about its ultimate purpose?\nagent: Through this exam, we'll be capable to determine and rate your disability, based on your disability's severity. That will influence directly on how much you'll receive, and varying between monthly payments and enrollments on veterans health care programs.\n",

                  "Frequently asked questions about decision reviews \n\n\nOn this page \nWhat s new and relevant evidence? What s Duty to Assist? What if I miss the deadline for submitting my request? What should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer? What should I expect if I request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge? What if I want to change my review option after submitting a form? How do I opt in if I want my legacy claim or appeal to be considered in the modernized system? \n\nWhat s new and relevant evidence? \nIn order to file a Supplemental Claim , you have to add evidence that s both new and relevant. New evidence is information that VA didn t have before the last decision. Relevant evidence is information that could prove or disprove something about your case. VA can t accept a Supplemental Claim without new and relevant evidence. You can either submit the evidence yourself or identify evidence, like medical records, that you d like VA to get for you. \n\nWhat s Duty to Assist? \nVA s Duty to Assist requires VA to assist you in getting evidence, such as medical records, that s needed to support your case. VA s Duty to Assist applies during your initial claim and if you file a Supplemental Claim. If you request a Higher - Level Review or Board Appeal , Duty to Assist doesn t apply. However , the reviewer or judge will look at whether VA met its Duty to Assist during your initial claim or Supplemental Claim , and if not, they ll have VA correct that error. Your review may take longer if this is needed.",
                  "What if I miss the deadline for submitting my request? \nSubmitting your request on time will ensure that you receive the maximum benefit if your case is granted. Please check the deadline for each review option and submit your request before that date. If the deadline has passed , you can either : Add new and relevant evidence and file a Supplemental Claim. Because the deadline has passed , the effective date for benefits will generally be tied to the date VA receives the new request, not the date VA received your initial claim. Send a letter to VA requesting that it revise the decision based on a Clear and Unmistakable Error CUE. CUE is a specific and rare kind of error. To prove CUE , you must show that the correct facts, known at the time, were not before VA or that VA incorrectly applied the law as it existed at the time. It must be undebatable that an error occurred and that this error changed the outcome of your case. Misinterpretation of the facts or a failure by VA to meet its Duty to Assist aren t sufficient reasons. Please seek guidance from a qualified representative, as you can only request CUE once per decision. If you disagree with a Board decision , your decision will have information on additional ways to address errors. \n\nWhat should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer? \nIf you request an informal conference with a senior reviewer on the Higher - Level Review option , they ll call the phone number that you or your representative provided on the Higher - Level Review form to schedule a time to discuss your case with you. The senior reviewer will try to reach you or your representative by phone twice. If no one answers , they ll leave a voice mail. During the call , you and/or your representative can talk about why you think the decision should be changed and identify errors. There won t be transcripts of this call.",
                  "How do I opt in if I want my legacy claim or appeal to be considered in the modernized system? \nIf you disagree with a VA decision you received before February 19 , 2019 , you can opt in to the modernized review system after you ve received a VA Statement of the Case SOC or Supplemental Statement of the Case SSOC. To get either a SOC or an SSOC , you must file a Notice of Disagreement VA Form 21 - 0958 within 1 year of the date on your decision. Find out how to file a Notice of Disagreement After you receive either a SOC or an SSOC on the issue in your Notice of Disagreement , you have 60 days or the remainder of the 1-year period following the decision you appealed, whichever is later, to opt in to the modernized system by submitting one of the following forms and checking the SOC / SSOC opt - in box : Decision Review Request : Supplemental Claim VA Form 20 - 0995 Decision Review Request : Higher - Level Review VA Form 20 - 0996 Decision Review Request : Board Appeal VA Form 10182 Download the forms or learn more about decision review options",

The judge may ask you a few questions. Your representative , if you have one , may help you at the hearing. The hearing will be transcribed and added to your appeal file. You can add new and relevant evidence within 90 days after the hearing , but it isn t required. \n\nWhat if I want to choose a different review option after I ve already submitted a form? \nIf you ve submitted a form and want to change your review option , you can send in a new decision review request form within 1 year from the date on your VA decision. You must include a letter that says you want to withdraw your existing review and switch to a different option. If you requested a Board Appeal and want to switch to a different appeal option , you can send in a new Board Appeal form with a different option selected.

                  "How to Review and Correct Your FAFSA Application \nFilling out and submitting your FAFSA form is an important step in the journey to paying for college. Learn about the next steps after submitting the application. We ll walk you through the actions you need to take to stay on track including accepting and getting your aid. \n\n\"After the FAFSA: What Happens Next?\" Video \nWatch the video on YouTube View accessible version wmv \n\nMake Sure Your FAFSA Form Was Processed \nAfter you submit your FAFSA form online or on the myStudentAid mobile app , you can check its status immediately. (Note: Only the student can check the status, because the FSA ID username and password are required to log in.) Here s how: Go to fafsa.gov or the myStudentAid mobile app and log in with your FSA ID username and password. The status of your application will be one of the following. Processing : Your application is still processing. It typically takes three to five days, plus one additional business day to be made available to the schools you listed on the form. Processed Successfully : Your application was processed successfully. No further action is needed. Missing Signatures : Your application is missing the required signature. Action Required : Your application requires further action. Contact your school to resolve the issue. If you submitted a paper FAFSA form , you can check its status after it has been processed roughly 7 10 days from the date mailed. You can also contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center to find out if your FAFSA application was processed.",
                  "So how do you find out how much aid you ll get? \nIf you ve been accepted at a college or career school that you listed on your FAFSA form , the school will calculate your aid and send you an electronic or paper aid offer, sometimes called an award letter, telling you how much aid you re eligible for at the school. The timing of the aid offer varies from school to school and could be as early as winter awarding for the fall or as late as immediately before you start school. It depends on when you apply and how the school prefers to schedule awarding of aid. \n\nProvide Required Verification \nYou might see a note on your SAR saying you ve been selected for verification ; or your school might contact you to inform you that you ve been selected. Verification is the process your school uses to confirm that the data reported on your FAFSA form is accurate. If you re selected for verification , your school will request additional documentation that supports the information you reported. Don t assume you re being accused of doing anything wrong. Some people are selected for verification at random ; and some schools verify all students' FAFSA forms. All you need to do is provide the documentation your school asks for and be sure to do so by the school s deadline , or you won t be able to get financial aid. If you used the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool IRS DRT when filling out your FAFSA form , you may not have to verify that information. In the following cases , however , your school may require you to submit an IRS tax transcript or a signed copy of your income tax return as part of the verification process. You didn t use the IRS DRT. You used the IRS DRT and reported rollovers. You used the IRS DRT but also amended your tax return. You can find your tax transcript through the IRS s Get Transcript service at irs.gov/transcript.",
                  "Understand the Full Impact of Your FAFSA Application \nNot only is your FAFSA form an application for federal student aid , it also is used in determining your eligibility for certain state and school financial aid. Your FAFSA information is shared with the colleges and/or career schools you list on the application. The financial aid office at a school uses your information to figure out how much aid you may receive at that school. Note: The school might also have other forms for you to fill out to get school aid, so check with the financial aid office to be sure. Your information also goes to your state higher education agency, as well as to agencies of the states where your chosen schools are located. Many states have financial aid funds that they give out based on FAFSA information. \n\nReview Your Student Aid Report (SAR) \nThe SAR is a summary of the FAFSA data you submitted. You the student will get your SAR within three days to three weeks after you submit your FAFSA form. Look over your SAR carefully, make sure you didn t make a mistake on your FAFSA form, and make corrections to your FAFSA data if necessary. Find out more about the SAR, its purpose, how the method you use to file your FAFSA form determines when you ll get the SAR, and what you should do with the SAR. \n\nWhat Not to Expect from the SAR \nThe SAR won t tell you how much financial aid you ll get. Also , if you used the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool IRS DRT when filling out your FAFSA form , the SAR won t show the details of your income and tax information.",
                  "Correct Mistakes or Make Updates to Your FAFSA Form \n\n\nCorrect Mistakes \nOnce your application has been processed , you can correct your FAFSA form online or on paper. \n\nMake Updates \nWhile most information cannot be changed on the FAFSA form , some information must be updated if it changes. Find out the difference and how to update FAFSA information. NOTE : Making corrections or updates online requires the student to sign in using his or her FSA ID username and password. The parent cannot sign in and make changes to the form. \n\nDecide What Aid to Accept \nFirst , you ll need to understand the aid that s being offered. For instance , is it free money such as a grant or scholarship , or is it a loan that you ll have to pay back? Next , decide what aid you really need, and then respond to the school s aid offer within the deadline set by the school. Learn more about accepting aid. \n\nLearn How Your Aid Is Paid Out \nIf you were offered financial aid and you accepted it , the financial aid staff at your college or career school will explain exactly how and when your aid will be paid out. They ll also tell you whether you need to fill out any more paperwork or meet other requirements. For instance , if you re receiving a federal student loan for the first time , you should expect to be required to sign a promissory note and go through entrance counseling. Be sure to keep in touch with your school s financial aid office so that you understand the whole process of receiving your aid."

You can t receive more need - based aid than the amount of your financial need. For instance , if your COA is $16,000 and your EFC is 12000 , your financial need is $4,000 ; so you aren t eligible for more than $4,000 in need - based aid. The following are the need - based federal student aid programs : Federal Pell Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant FSEOG Direct Subsidized Loan Federal Perkins Loan Federal Work-Study \n\nWhat is non-need-based aid and how does my school figure out how much I ll get? \nYour school determines how much non - need - based aid you can get by using this formula : Calculating Your Non - need - based Aid Cost of Attendance COA Financial Aid Awarded So Far * = Eligibility for Non - need - based Aid * includes aid from all sources, such as the school, private scholarship providers, etc. Non - need - based aid is financial aid that is not based on your EFC. What matters is your COA and how much other assistance you ve been awarded so far. For instance , if your COA is $16,000 and you ve been awarded a total of $4,000 in need - based aid and private scholarships , you can get up to $12,000 in non - need - based aid. The following are the non - need - based federal student aid programs : Direct Unsubsidized Loan Federal PLUS Loan Teacher Education Access for College and Higher Education TEACH Grant",
                  "What does cost of attendance (COA) mean? \nYour COA is the amount it will cost you to go to school. Most two - year and four - year colleges will calculate your COA to show your total cost for the school year for instance, for the fall semester plus the spring semester. Schools with programs that last a different period of time for instance, an 18-month certificate program might give you a COA that covers a time period other than a year. If you're attending at least half - time , your COA is the estimate of tuition and fees; the cost of room and board or living expenses for students who do not contract with the school for room and board ; the cost of books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and miscellaneous expenses including a reasonable amount for the documented cost of a personal computer ; an allowance for child care or other dependent care ; costs related to a disability ; and/or reasonable costs for eligible study - abroad programs. \n\nWhat s the Expected Family Contribution (EFC)? \nYour EFC is an index number that college financial aid staff use to determine how much financial aid you would receive if you were to attend their school. The information you report on your FAFSA form is used to calculate your EFC. The EFC is calculated according to a formula established by law. Your family's taxed and untaxed income, assets, and benefits such as unemployment or Social Security all could be considered in the formula. Also considered are your family size and the number of family members who will attend college or career school during the year. The EFC Formula guide shows exactly how an EFC is calculated.",
                  "Wondering how the amount of your federal student aid is determined? \nThe colleges or career schools you list on your Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA form will use several pieces of information to calculate your aid. So, you ve filed your FAFSAform, and you ve checked your Student Aid Report to be sure all your information is correct , and now you re wondering how that data is used to come up with the list of financial aid for which you re eligible. \n\nIf I meet the basic eligibility criteria for federal student aid, who decides how much money I ll get? \nHere s the short answer : Your eligibility depends on your Expected Family Contribution, your year in school, your enrollment status, and the cost of attendance at the school you will be attending. The financial aid office at your college or career school will determine how much financial aid you are eligible to receive. The financial aid staff starts by deciding upon your cost of attendance COA at that school. They then consider your Expected Family Contribution EFC. They subtract your EFC from your COA to determine the amount of your financial need and therefore how much need - based aid you can get. To determine how much non - need - based aid you can get , the school takes your cost of attendance and subtracts any financial aid you ve already been awarded.

Make sure it includes amounts you will pay to the school directly such as tuition and fees as well as other costs such as living expenses, books and supplies, and transportation. Next , subtract the grant and scholarship amounts on your aid offer from the cost of attendance amount. Also subtract any savings you have available to put toward your school costs for the school year. The remaining amount is your net or out - of - pocket cost. Compare the net costs for the schools you are considering. The net cost is the amount you will have to pay out of your pocket, using earnings from work or loan funds that you borrow. If you have any questions or don t understand what s in your aid offer , contact the financial aid office at the school. They re there to help! For instance , it s important to understand what you re being offered e.g., which items in the offer are grants and which are loans. You also need to think about which aid to accept. Also , because your aid offer might include student loans , it s important for you to compare the amount of debt you would be taking on at the schools you are considering. If you find that you ll need to take out a larger amount in private loans at one school than at another , you should pay special attention to the terms and conditions of the private loans so you understand what your obligations would be.

To qualify , the payment you would be required to make under the PAYE or IBR plan based on your income and family size must be less than what you would pay under the Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period.

Generally , you'll meet this requirement if your federal student loan debt is higher than your annual discretionary income or represents a significant portion of your annual income. In addition to meeting the requirement described above , to qualify for the PAYE Plan you must also be a new borrower. This means that you must have had no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan when you received a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2007, and you must have received a disbursement of a Direct Loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2011. \n\nICR Plan \nAny borrower with eligible federal student loans can make payments under this plan.

For example , if you complete five consecutive years of qualifying teaching and receive forgiveness of your Direct Loans under the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program , any payments you made on your Direct Loans during that five - year period cannot be counted toward the required 120 monthly payments for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. To receive Public Service Loan Forgiveness , you would need to make 120 more qualifying monthly payments.",
                  "Teacher Loan Forgiveness and AmeriCorps Program Benefits \nIf you re an AmeriCorps Program volunteer , a period of teaching that qualifies you for a benefit through the AmeriCorps Program cannot be counted toward the required five consecutive years of teaching for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program. \n\nCan I receive teacher loan forgiveness on my PLUS loans or Federal Perkins Loans? \nPLUS loans for parents and graduate or professional students aren t eligible for this type of forgiveness. Federal Perkins Loans aren t eligible for this type of forgiveness. However , you may be eligible to have all or a portion of your Federal Perkins Loan canceled based on your employment or volunteer service or discharged under certain conditions. \n\nAm I eligible for teacher loan forgiveness if I m in default on a loan? \nIf you re in default on a loan , you are not eligible for forgiveness of that loan unless you have made satisfactory repayment arrangements with the holder of the defaulted loan. \n\nHow and when do I apply for teacher loan forgiveness? \nYou apply for teacher loan forgiveness by submitting a completed Teacher Loan Forgiveness Application to your loan servicer after you have completed the required five consecutive years of qualifying teaching. The chief administrative officer of the school or educational service agency where you performed your qualifying teaching service must complete the certification section. If you are applying for forgiveness of loans that are with different loan servicers , you must submit a separate form to each of them.",
                  "The school or educational service agency must be listed in the Teacher Cancellation Low Income TCLI Directory, which is published by the U.S. Department of Education ED each year. To find out if your school or educational service agency is classified as low - income , search the directory database for the years you have been employed as a teacher. If the TCLI Directory is not available before May 1 of any year , the previous year s directory may be used for that year. Any questions about the inclusion or omission of a particular school must be directed to the state education agency contact in the state where the school is located and not to ED. State education agencies are responsible for determining which schools or educational service agencies are eligible to be reported to ED for inclusion in the TCLI Directory. If your school or educational service agency is included in the TCLI Directory for at least one year of your teaching service, but is not included during subsequent years , your subsequent years of teaching at the school or educational service agency will still be counted toward the required five complete and consecutive academic years of teaching. For example , if you taught at the same school for five complete and consecutive academic years from 2011 12 through 2015 16, but the school was included in the TCLI Directory only for the 2011 12 academic year , your subsequent four academic years of teaching at that school can still be counted toward the required five complete and consecutive academic years. Teaching service performed at an educational service agency may be counted toward the required five years of teaching only if the consecutive five - year period includes qualifying service at an eligible educational service agency performed after the 2007 08 academic year. All elementary and secondary schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Education BIE or operated on Indian reservations by Indian tribal groups under contract with BIE qualify as schools serving low - income students. These schools are qualifying schools for the purposes of this loan forgiveness program, even if they are not listed in the TCLI",
                  "Teaching for Less Than a Complete Academic Year \nIf you were unable to complete a full academic year of teaching , that year may still be counted toward the required five complete and consecutive academic years if you completed at least one - half of the academic year ; and your employer considers you to have fulfilled your contract requirements for the academic year for the purposes of salary increases, tenure, and retirement ; and you were unable to complete the academic year because you returned to postsecondary education, on at least a half - time basis, in an area of study directly related to the performance of the teaching service described above ; you had a condition covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 FMLA ; or you were called or ordered to active duty status for more than 30 days as a member of a reserve component of the U.S. armed forces. \n\nWho is considered a teacher? \nA teacher is a person who provides direct classroom teaching, or classroom - type teaching in a nonclassroom setting. Special education teachers are considered teachers. \n\nAm I a highly qualified teacher? \nThere are basic requirements that all teachers must meet to be considered highly qualified. There are also additional requirements that you must meet depending on whether you re an elementary or secondary school teacher, and whether you re new to the teaching profession. \n\nBasic Requirements for All Teachers \nTo be a highly qualified teacher , you must have attained at least a bachelor s degree ; received full state certification as a teacher ; and not had certification or licensure requirements waived on an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis. You re considered to have received full state certification even if you received your certification through alternative routes to certification or by passing the state teacher licensing examination. If you re a teacher at a public charter school , you are considered to have received full state certification as a teacher if you meet the requirements set forth in the state's public charter school law."

The school you select will use the information collected to determine your eligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan and process your application. Before you can receive a Direct PLUS Loan , you must complete a Direct PLUS Loan Master Promissory Note Direct PLUS Loan MPN, which explains all of the terms and conditions of Direct PLUS Loans and constitutes your legally binding agreement to repay all Direct PLUS Loans that you receive under the Direct PLUS Loan MPN.

                  "Federal student loans for college or career school are an investment in your future. \nYou must repay your loan, so be sure you understand your options and responsibilities. If you apply for financial aid , you may be offered loans as part of your school s financial aid offer. A loan is money you borrow and must pay back with interest. If you decide to take out a loan , make sure you understand who is making the loan and the terms and conditions of the loan. Student loans can come from the federal government, from private sources such as a bank or financial institution, or from other organizations. Loans made by the federal government, called federal student loans, usually have more benefits than loans from banks or other private sources. Learn more about the differences between federal and private student loans. \n\nWhat types of federal student loans are available? \nThe U.S. Department of Education s federal student loan program is the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program. Under this program , the U.S. Department of Education is your lender. There are four types of Direct Loans available : Direct Subsidized Loans are loans made to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need to help cover the costs of higher education at a college or career school. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are loans made to eligible undergraduate, graduate, and professional students , but eligibility is not based on financial need. Direct PLUS Loans are loans made to graduate or professional students and parents of dependent undergraduate students to help pay for education expenses not covered by other financial aid. Eligibility is not based on financial need , but a credit check is required. Borrowers who have an adverse credit history must meet additional requirements to qualify. Direct Consolidation Loans allow you to combine all of your eligible federal student loans into a single loan with a single loan servicer.

                  "How do I get a federal student loan? \nTo apply for a federal student loan , you must first complete and submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA form. Based on the results of your FAFSA form , your college or career school will send you a financial aid offer, which may include federal student loans. Your school will tell you how to accept all or a part of the loan. Before you receive your loan funds , you will be required to complete entrance counseling , a tool to ensure you understand your obligation to repay the loan ; and sign a Master Promissory Note, agreeing to the terms of the loan. Contact the financial aid office at the school you are planning to attend for details regarding the process at your school.",
                  "What should I consider when taking out federal student loans?",
                  "Before you take out a loan , it s important to understand that a loan is a legal obligation that makes you responsible for repaying the amount you borrow with interest. Even though you don t have to begin repaying your federal student loans right away , you shouldn t wait to understand your responsibilities as a borrower. Get the scoop: Watch this video about responsible borrowing or browse the tips below it. Be a responsible borrower. Keep track of how much you re borrowing. Think about how the amount of your loans will affect your future finances, and how much you can afford to repay. Your student loan payments should be only a small percentage of your salary after you graduate , so it s important not to borrow more than you need for your school - related expenses. Research starting salaries in your field. Ask your school for starting salaries of recent graduates in your field of study to get an idea of how much you are likely to earn after you graduate. You can also use the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook or career search tool to research careers and salaries. Understand the terms of your loan and keep copies of your loan documents. When you sign your promissory note , you are agreeing to repay the loan according to the terms of the note even if you don t complete your education, can t get a job after you complete the program, or you didn t like the education you received. Make payments on time. You are required to make payments on time even if you don t receive a bill, repayment notice, or a reminder. You must pay the full amount required by your repayment plan, as partial payments do not fulfill your obligation to repay your student loan on time. Keep in touch with your loan servicer. Notify your loan servicer when you graduate ; withdraw from school ; drop below half - time status ; transfer to another school; or change your name, address, or Social Security number. You also should contact your servicer if you re having trouble making your scheduled loan"

Federal Pell Grants : If you meet the requirements above and are eligible to receive a Pell Grant , you will receive an Expected Family Contribution EFC of zero, which maximizes your Pell Grant eligibility and can increase your eligibility for other federal student aid programs. Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants : If you meet the requirements above but are not eligible for a Pell Grant based on your EFC, you will be eligible to receive the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant. The maximum amount of the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant is the same as the maximum Pell Grant award. Your EFC will not be affected , and therefore neither will your eligibility for any need - based federal student aid."

                  "When it comes to paying for college, career school, or graduate school, federal student loans can offer several advantages over private student loans. \nNeed a loan to help pay for college? Consider federal loans first! If you apply for financial aid , your school will likely include student loans as part of your financial aid package. It s important to understand what types of loans you are offered. Generally , there are two types of student loans federal and private. Federal student loans and federal parent loans : These loans are funded by the federal government. Private student loans: These loans are nonfederal loans, made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or a school. \n\nIf you need to borrow money to pay for college or career school, start with federal loans. \nFederal student loans are Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Direct PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students. Federal parent loans are Direct PLUS Loans for parents. Parents are fully responsible for paying these loans, even though they are taken out to benefit students. \n\nWhat are the differences between federal and private student loans? \nFederal student loans are made by the government, with terms and conditions that are set by law, and include many benefits such as fixed interest rates and income - driven repayment plans not typically offered with private loans. In contrast , private loans are made by private organizations such banks, credit unions, and state - based or state - affiliated organizations, and have terms and conditions that are set by the lender. Private student loans are generally more expensive than federal student loans. The chart below provides a summary of the differences. Private loans differ by lender and by type of loan.

                  "Missing or Duplicate High Schools \n\n\nWhy isn't my high school listed in these data files? \nThere are two primary reasons that you may not see your school on the list. Your school will not appear on the report if there are fewer than five completed applications. Your school may appear on the report , but it may be listed under an alternative name. Since school names are inherently student - reported , the reported name can vary considerably. In aggregating the data , our standard practice is to report the school name that is most commonly reported by applicants. It is possible this name is different than your formal school name. As a result , it is important to look for other variations of your school name and city. You do not need to request to be added to the list. Once a high school shows at least five completed FAFSA forms , their submission and completion totals will appear in the database.",
                  "Questions and Answers About FAFSA Completion Data \nBelow are questions we ve heard about the Completion by High School and Public School District\">data we provide on FAFSA completion by high school. \n\nBasics \n\n\nMissing or Duplicate High Schools \n\n\nLow Completion Totals \n\n\nTechnical and Analytical \n\n\nBasics \n\n\nWhat is the source of data? \nThe source of the data is the U.S. Department of Education's Central Processing System. \n\nWhat years of Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) submission and completion data are available? \nFederal Student Aid releases data for the current 2018 19 cycle and provides a side - by - side comparison of the previous 2017 18 cycle. We also have an archive that contains data files from the 2017 18 cycle comparing it to the past 2016 17 cycle. Each file has the previous cycle data through the same date in the prior year as well as the 6-month and 12-month numbers for the previous cycle. Only numbers of submitted and completed FAFSA forms are available. No personally identifiable information for any FAFSA filer will be shared through this process. Email us at HSFAFSA@ed.gov if you see data that is inaccurate and/or you have suggestions for improvement. We welcome your input.",
                  "What is the difference between a submitted and a completed FAFSA form? \nSubmitted applications reflect all FAFSA forms submitted by students at that high school. These applications , however , can be subsequently rejected by the Central Processing System if they are missing key pieces of information. The applications that are not rejected are referred to as completed applications. Completed applications , therefore , are a subset of all submitted applications. If a FAFSA form is submitted but not complete , the student will receive an email from the Department of Education asking him or her to correct the FAFSA form. A completed FAFSA form is necessary to determine eligibility for federal student aid and often other forms of financial aid. \n\nHow often will the FAFSA submission data be updated? \nFrom October through June , data releases are weekly. For the remainder of the calendar year , data releases occur every other Friday. (For high schools to track their progress, Federal Student Aid regularly updates estimates for the first 12 months of an application cycle. As of the 2017 18 FAFSA cycle, this is extended to the first 15 months of the application cycle and will cover October of one year through December of the following year.) \n\nMissing or Duplicate High Schools",
                  "Can I add up all the submitted applications from a single state file to calculate a state total? What about adding up all the submitted applications from a single city? \nThe answer to both questions is no. The official location of a school or the location most commonly reported by students may actually be a suburb falling within a larger city's limits. For example , adding up all the applications reported under \" New York City \" would exclude any institutions reported being within \" Queens \" or even within \" Jamaica, \" a smaller neighborhood within the New York City Borough of Queens. Any analysis must also consider the impact of withholding the totals or names of schools with fewer than five completed applications. At its most basic level , summing the number of applications reported in these files always underestimates the number of applications. If an institution is reported as having \" <5 \" completed applications , one cannot assume there were zero applications. Further , the totals for some schools are never made public because their class sizes essentially preclude them from having enough completed applications to ever be disclosed publicly. Because this impacts some areas more than others , be sure to consider these and other factors when conducting any analyses. \n\nWhy do some districts appear in white on the maps? \nDistricts are listed as missing / insufficient data if any of the following conditions are true : The regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate is missing e.g., if districts merged or a new district was created after 2009 10. A district has fewer than 15 students in the regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate data. There s an unpredicted increase in the number of district graduating seniors e.g., a dramatic increase in the graduation rate, or if two districts merge under one district's name. A district has fewer than 10 projected graduates. A district has fewer than five completed FAFSA forms. The National Center Education Statistics Local Education Agency LEA code does not match the LEA code found in the Tiger / Line shapefile for the state.",
                  "Why do there appear to be duplicates of the same school? \nSince these school names are inherently student - reported , the reported name can vary considerably. In aggregating the data , our standard practice is to report the school name that is most commonly reported by applicants. However , when we are unable to determine if school name variations are referring to the same school , we err on the side of caution and do not aggregate the data to a single record and applicant count.

Email us at HSFAFSA@ed.gov if you believe your school has been listed more than once. \n\nLow Completion Totals \n\n\nWhy is my number of FAFSA submissions or completions lower than I think it should be? \nWhile we know that many high schools inadvertently overestimate their FAFSA completion rates , one reason your rates may be lower than expected is because your school could be listed more than once. This happens if students entered your school name in different ways on the FAFSA form. For instance , if some students listed \" John Doe High School \" and other students listed \" Doe High School , \" then your high school could be listed in more than one place. Please look for alternate names for your school. Email us at HSFAFSA@ed.gov if you find your school has been listed more than once. \n\nI am a high school counselor or college access professional.

                  "I am a counselor at a high school with a lot of students age 20 or older. Why are my numbers so low? \nBecause there is no question on the FAFSA form that asks if an applicant is a high school senior , we must use several criteria to identify those applicants that are likely high school seniors. In this instance , the bulk of the students would likely not satisfy the age criteria requiring applicants to be less than 20 years of age at the cutoff date. Also , students must also be receiving their high school diploma, as opposed to a GED or other program, to fit this definition of a high school senior. \n\nTechnical and Analytical \n\n\nThe totals reported last year are different from the numbers reported now about last year. What is causing this? \nThere could be several causes for this, including the possibility that your institution is listed more than once in the data using alternate variations of the school's name or city. One other cause is a change we made in 2017 to our definition of a high school senior, which now aligns with other data we publicly release. In past years, we used proxies to determine whether an applicant was a first - time filer ; we now use true first - time filer status as one criterion for being a senior. While this impacts a relatively small number of applicants, if your total decreased compared to what we reported last year , then this may mean there were applicants that had applied in a previous year.",

The FAFSA questions use gender - neutral terminology for married parents Parent 1 father / mother / stepparent \" and Parent 2 father / mother / stepparent \" instead of mother \" and father \".

When your school gives you financial aid , sometimes money is left over after your aid is applied to your tuition, fees, and other school charges. This remaining amount is called a credit balance. If you have a credit balance , your school must pay this amount to you directly within 14 days unless you authorize the school to keep the money to pay for future institutional charges. The amount the school is required to provide is either the amount of your credit balance or the amount needed for books and supplies as determined by your school, whichever is less. Your school can tell you if this applies to you. Even if the school s preferred arrangement is to provide vouchers or other means for you to get your course materials through the school or its bookstore , the school must provide you the opportunity to opt out, receive a check from the school, and obtain the books and supplies on your own unless one of the following exceptions applies : The school can demonstrate a compelling health and safety reason for obtaining the materials through the institution or its supplier.

If you don t receive the type or amount of financial aid you expected , contact your school. The financial aid office can explain how your aid was determined. \n\nHow You ll Receive Your Financial Aid \nHow you ll get your aid depends on the type of aid you accepted. \n\nGrants and Student Loans \nTypically , the school first applies your grant or loan money toward your tuition, fees, and if you live on campus room and board. Any money left over is paid to you directly for other education expenses. If you get your loan money , but then you realize that you don t need the money after all , you may cancel all or part of your loan within 120 days of receiving it and no interest or fees will be charged. \n\nWork-Study \nYour school must pay you directly unless you request that the school send your payments directly to your bank account or use the money to pay for education - related charges e.g., tuition, fees, room and board on your student account. \n\nDirect PLUS Loans for Parents \nIn most cases , your child s school will give you your loan money by crediting it to your child s school account to pay tuition, fees, room, board, and other authorized charges. If there is money left over , the school will pay it to you. In some cases , with your permission , the school may give the leftover money to your child. If you take out a loan as a student or parent , your school or your child s school will notify you in writing each time they give you any part of your loan money. At the same time , they ll provide information about how to cancel all or part of your loan if you find you no longer need the full amount. You will also receive a notice from your loan servicer confirming that you received the loan money.",
                  "You should ask your financial aid office about this because it varies from school to school. For example , if the school offers a bookstore voucher or other means for students to receive their books and supplies through the school or its bookstore , you could obtain your materials that way. When your school gives you financial aid , sometimes money is left over after your aid is applied to your tuition, fees, and other school charges. This remaining amount is called a credit balance. If you have a credit balance , your school must pay this amount to you directly within 14 days unless you authorize the school to keep the money to pay for future institutional charges. The amount the school is required to provide is either the amount of your credit balance or the amount needed for books and supplies as determined by your school, whichever is less. Your school can tell you if this applies to you. Even if the school s preferred arrangement is to provide vouchers or other means for you to get your course materials through the school or its bookstore , the school must provide you the opportunity to opt out, receive a check from the school, and obtain the books and supplies on your own unless one of the following exceptions applies : The school can demonstrate a compelling health and safety reason for obtaining the materials through the institution or its supplier. The school can demonstrate that the materials are not currently available elsewhere or accessible to students via other means. Saving Money on Textbooks and Course Materials Depending on what materials are available at your school and for your courses , you may have several lower - cost options to obtain your books : If your course uses a hard - copy textbook , consider buying a used copy or renting your textbook from a bookstore or online. If you purchase your textbook , consider reselling that textbook, if allowed, when you are done with the course. Even with new textbooks , you may be able to save money by shopping around. Some schools use open - access texts and online content to offer students further savings over hard - copy textbooks. Open - access"
